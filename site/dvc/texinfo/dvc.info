1 DVC
*****

DVC is an Emacs front end for various Decentralized Version Control
systems. It is the successor of Xtla, which was the Emacs front-end to
tla (GNU Arch).

   The main features are:

   * dvc-status: Intuitive interface for viewing the status of a
     working directory.

   * dvc-log: Log viewer.  Perform actions on specific commits, such as
     viewing them and emailing them.

   * dvc-diff: View uncommitted changes in your working directory and
     use them to prepare a commit log entry.

   * dvc-bookmarks: Bookmark manager.  Keep your most frequently used
     repositories and working directories in your bookmark buffer.
     Also, specify "partner" branches or repositories, whose changes
     can be compared with your work.

   * Integration with ediff, which is an excellent visual interface for
     changes between multiple files/versions.  This Emacs mode is
     useful for:
        * Viewing changes made in a local tree.

        * Viewing and resolving conflicts after a merge.

   * dvc-missing: Interface to view missing patches from all your
     partners with a single command

   * Send/receive/apply patches via the Gnus email client.

   * Run many version control commands from Emacs (such as init and
     pull).

1.1 Installation
================

This program consists of several groups of files, organized by
directory:

          lisp     - the main program code
          texinfo  - the documentation files
          docs     - text documents for hacking DVC

File: dvc.info,  Node: Dependencies,  Next: MS Windows,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

1.1.1 Dependencies
------------------

Various parts of the DVC require extra packages to be available.
Currently there are the following dependencies:

   * `ewoc.el': a utility to maintain a view of a list of objects in a
     buffer.  This is essential for dvc and a version of `ewoc.el' is
     included in the distribution until available by an stable version
     of XEmacs. It is already included in GNU Emacs 21.

   * `tree-widget.el' is required for `xtla-browse.el'.  The CVS
     version of GNU Emacs includes `tree-widget.el'. XEmacs users
     should install the latest `jde' package which includes
     `tree-widget.el'.

     You can also install it as a standalone package. The latest
     version of `tree-widget.el' can be found at
     `http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/lisp/tree-widget.el'

     If `tree-widget.el' is not in your default `load-path', you should
     provide its location with the argument `--with-other-dirs' of the
     `configure' script.

   * `smerge-mode.el': Minor mode to resolve diff3 conflicts.  It is
     not essential, but reduces resolving of conflicts to deciding which
     version to keep.

     The latest version of `smerge-mode.el' can be found at
     `http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/emacs/emacs/lisp/smerge-mode.el'



File: dvc.info,  Node: MS Windows,  Next: Hooking into GNU Emacs,  Prev: Dependencies,  Up: Installation

1.1.2 MS Windows
----------------

DVC requires a POSIX shell, used to run the backends. On Unix-like
systems, `/bin/sh' should be good. On MS Windows, you will need to
install one. MinGW and Cygwin both work; other POSIX shells are also
available.

   For MinGW, see `http://mingw.org/', and see
`http://www.venge.net/mtn-wiki/BuildingOnWindows' for excellent
installation instructions.

   For Cygwin, see `http://cygwin.com/'.

   Both MinGW and Cygwin work better with native MS Windows Emacs if
installed to `c:/' instead of `c:/MinGW' or `c:/Cygwin'. This is
because of the way they mount filesystems, and refer to files not under
a mounted directory.

   For example, if Cygwin is installed at `c:/Cygwin', it mounts `/' at
`c:/Cygwin'. Then the file known to Emacs as `c:/Cygwin/bin/make.exe'
is known to Cygwin applications as `/bin/make.exe'. Also, the file
known to Emacs as `c:/Projects/my_file.text' is known to Cygwin as
`/cygdrive/c/Projects/my_file.text'. This causes problems when using
Cygwin make with native Emacs; Emacs can't find the files make is
reporting in error messages.

   However, if Cygwin is installed at `c:/', then it mounts `/' at
`c:/'. Then the file known to Emacs as `c:/bin/make.exe' is known to
Cygwin applications as `/bin/make.exe'. Also, the file known to Emacs
as `c:/Projects/my_file.text' is known to Cygwin as
`/Projects/my_file.text'. The only difference is the leading drive
letter, which is unnecessary, as long as all files are on the same
drive, which is typical of MS Windows boxes these days.

   MinGW has similar file naming conventions.

   The Cygwin installer warns that installing Cygwin at `c:/' is not
recommended. But if you read the rationale for that in the Cygwin docs,
it is because "you might have other things installed there that
conflict". While true, that is up to you to control. For example, you
certainly cannot install _both_ Cygwin and MinGW at `c:/'.

   In general, a backend used by DVC should be run by invoking a Windows
executable, not a DOS batch file or other script. The Emacs variable
`explicit-shell-file-name' may help in resolving shell issues.

1.1.3 Hooking into GNU Emacs
----------------------------

(There is nothing to do for XEmacs users here, just start using DVC,
i.e. goto *note DVC Tla Tour::)

   If you are reading this document the installation of files and
setting up the `load-path' and `Info-directory-list' was already
successful and you just need to load DVC now.

   If auto-loading was built correctly you may start with `M-x
tla-archives RET'.

   In order to load DVC on Emacs start up you should include the
following form in your Emacs configuration file, e.g. `~/.emacs.el':

     `(load-file "/path/to/dvc/builddir/dvc-load.el")'

   Alternatively, you can set your load-path and load the autoload files
manually with

     `(require 'dvc-autoloads)'
     `(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dvc/lisp/")'

   This will set up DVC.

1.2.1 A tutorial guide to DVC
-----------------------------

The following sections present a step-by-step tutorial guide to using
DVC for some common tasks: registering an archive, bookmarking an
existing project, creating your own local branch, getting a working
tree, merging patches from the main branch and committing changes to
your tree.

   For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the DVC project as an
example of a project you might like to track (humour me).

* Menu:

* Register an tla archive::
* Bookmarking a project::
* Creating a branch of a project and getting a project tree::
* Finding and merging missing patches::
* Reviewing and committing your changes::


File: dvc.info,  Node: Register an tla archive,  Next: Bookmarking a project,  Prev: A tutorial guide to DVC,  Up: A tutorial guide to DVC

1.2.1.1 Register an tla archive
...............................

The first step in tracking a project's development is to register its
archive in your archive list.  You can do this by starting the archive
browser (`C-x V A') and typing `a r' to register a new archive.  DVC's
archive location is currently
`http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/arch/public/', and the default value
for the archive name will be fine.  Having done this, you should now
see the newly-registered archive listed.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Bookmarking a project,  Next: Creating a branch of a project and getting a project tree,  Prev: Register an tla archive,  Up: A tutorial guide to DVC

1.2.1.2 Bookmarking a project
.............................

The normal usage of DVC is to create a bookmark for each version of a
project you are currently interested in.  Much of the arch's
functionality is available from the bookmarks buffer, and it is one of
the primary entry points for DVC.

   To track DVC's development, you will most likely want to add a
bookmark for its main development line.  You can do this by entering the
bookmarks buffer (`C-x V b') and adding a new bookmark with (`a b', or
"add bookmark").  You should be prompted for a version name, and you
can use tab completion to enter
`Matthieu.Moy@imag.fr--public/dvc--main--0'.  You can give your
bookmark any name you like.

   Pressing `RET' on your newly-added bookmark will show you a revision
list for that version.  You can use this list to browse archive logs
(`RET' again), view changesets (`=') and various other tasks.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Creating a branch of a project and getting a project tree,  Next: Finding and merging missing patches,  Prev: Bookmarking a project,  Up: A tutorial guide to DVC

1.2.1.3 Creating a branch of a project and getting a project tree
.................................................................

Having created a bookmark for the DVC project, you are ready to create
your own branch.  Again from the bookmarks buffer (`C-x V b'), move the
point to your bookmark for DVC and hit `M T'.  You will be prompted for
the tag version to be created for your new branch.  Put the branch
somewhere in your default archive (I put mine in
`mark@dishevelled.net--2003-mst/dvc--main--0.1'.)  This will create a
tag of the main DVC project in your own archive and add a bookmark for
it.

   Your newly-added bookmark will be marked as a "partner" of your main
DVC bookmark.  This records the fact that the two projects are related
so that DVC can show you which patches from the DVC mainline are
missing from your local tree, and other useful stuff (more on this
later).

   At this point, you will probably want to get a project tree for your
new branch.  You can do this by moving your point to its bookmark in the
bookmark buffer, and hitting `>'.  You will be prompted for a directory
in which to place the project tree, and the revision to get (the
default is fine in this case).  Once the project tree has been fetched,
it will be automatically opened in dired.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Finding and merging missing patches,  Next: Reviewing and committing your changes,  Prev: Creating a branch of a project and getting a project tree,  Up: A tutorial guide to DVC

1.2.1.4 Finding and merging missing patches
...........................................

Before you start making changes, it is a good idea to see if any new
patches have been added to the mainline since you last checked.  DVC is
particularly good at doing this.

   Start by entering the bookmarks buffer (`C-x V b'), move your point
to the bookmark of your DVC branch and hit `M m'.  A `*tla-missing*'
buffer should appear, and show any patches that are in the mainline but
not in your tree.

   To merge all missing patches from the DVC mainline into your project
tree, move your point to the DVC mainline partner entry and hit `M s'.
You will be prompted for the path of your local project tree, and after
the patches have been merged a changes buffer should be displayed.

   If you don't want to merge all the missing patches, you can leave off
the `M' prefix.  For example, `r' will replay only the revision under
the point (allowing you to cherry-pick patches), and `s' will
star-merge all missing patches up to the patch under the point.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Reviewing and committing your changes,  Prev: Finding and merging missing patches,  Up: A tutorial guide to DVC

1.2.1.5 Reviewing and committing your changes
.............................................

After making changes to your project tree, you are ready to commit.  You
can review your changes by typing `C-x V =' from within your project
tree, and a `*tla-changes*' buffer should appear with diff output.
Before committing, you might also like to tree-lint your local tree by
hitting `C-x V l' (but this is done automatically if `tla changes'
fails and suggests a `tree-lint').

   Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can create a log file
by hitting `C-x V c' (or simply `c' from your `*tla-changes*' buffer).
Many users prefer to write their log file incrementally, and you can
always save this file and hit `C-x V c' to return to it later.  You can
also add a ChangeLog-style entry by hitting `C-x V a' from the project
tree file you are currently visiting.

   To commit your changes, type `C-c C-c' from your log buffer.


File: dvc.info,  Node: First contact,  Next: Tla Archive Browsing,  Prev: A tutorial guide to DVC,  Up: DVC Tla Tour

1.2.2 First contact
-------------------

DVC is self documented, so this manual will be very short. We suppose
you understand tla basics.

   There is a DVC entry in the tools menu which is a good starting
point, and an "Tla-..." menu in most DVC-related modes. Once you have
learnt the keyboard shortcuts, you will not need the menus anymore.

   The most important commands have global keybindings. The prefix is
`C-x V' by default. Type `C-x V C-h' for a list. In each DVC specific
buffer, other (shorter) keyboard shortcuts are available. `C-h m' will
give you a list.

   To get help about a tla command, `C-x V h command RET' will show you
the output of `tla command -H'. Since DVC is nothing more than a
wrapper around tla, this is a very good way to get help !

   Before starting, you will need to set your ID if you have not already
done so.

   You can execute the following command to set your id:

   `C-u M-x tla-my-id' (or `M-x tla-set-my-id RET')

   To check your id, call the same command without a prefix argument:

   `M-x tla-my-id'


File: dvc.info,  Node: Tla Archive Browsing,  Next: Editing Files,  Prev: First contact,  Up: DVC Tla Tour

1.2.3 Tla Archive Browsing
--------------------------

It is pretty intuitive, just type `C-x V A' and investigate the menu
bar (Hmm, many people usually deactivate the menu bar, but please,
enable it while learning DVC ;-) You'll remove it afterwards) and the
mode help by `C-h m'.

   If you have no archives registered yet, type `a r' and provide the
location of an archive.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Editing Files,  Next: Committing Files,  Prev: Tla Archive Browsing,  Up: DVC Tla Tour

1.2.4 Editing Files
-------------------

Adding new files can be done in two ways:

  1. Add an arch-tag to the file, by typing `C-x V t'. Attention, files
     used as templates (`Makefile.in') should be added explicitly
     instead of using arch-tag lines.

  2. Explicitly add it from the inventory view. Type `C-x V i', mark
     the new files by typing `m' and finally add them by typing `a'.


   You are encouraged to add log entries while you are editing.  Type
`C-x V a' add your notes.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Committing Files,  Next: Using Bookmarks,  Prev: Editing Files,  Up: DVC Tla Tour

1.2.5 Committing Files
----------------------

  1. First review your changes by typing `C-x V ='.

     If your tree contains nested trees, then DVC will display the list
     of nested trees at the top of the changes buffer. They are marked
     with a `T' so that you can distinguish them from the modified
     files.  While computing, they have the status `?', and this becomes
     `M' (resp. `-') when the recursively called `tla' process exits if
     there are some changes (resp. no changes) in the nested tree.

     To view the details of the changes, type `RET' on a nested tree
     entry to open the corresponding changes buffer. To come back to the
     root of the project, type `^'.

  2. Then review the log message by typing `c' within the *tla-changes*
     buffer and edit it when needed.

  3. Finally commit by typing `C-c C-c'.

   If you want to commit only changes made to a given number of files,
select them with `m' in the *tla-changes* buffer (this also works from
the *tla-inventory* buffer) before typing `c'. The list of files used
for the selected files commit is the list of selected files in the
buffer in which you typed `c', at the time you press `C-c C-c' to
commit. So, if you change your mind, you can go back and select/unselect
some files before committing.

File: dvc.info,  Node: Bookmarks basics,  Next: Using bookmarks for distributed development,  Prev: Using Bookmarks,  Up: Using Bookmarks

1.2.6.1 Bookmarks basics
........................

Bookmarks are primarily used to keep a list of the most visited arch
locations. Type `C-x V b' will show you the bookmarks buffer. It should
be empty for now, but you can add some by typing `a'.

   Ah, it's a pain, you have to type the full location, like
`Matthieu.Moy@imag.fr--public/dvc--main--0.1', or just
`Matthieu.Moy@imag.fr--public/dvc--main'.  No, let's do it the easy
way: Go back to your archive list (`M-x tla-archives RET'), select the
archive you want, then the category, branch, version. Now, just select
Set a bookmark here in the menu, type the name, and that's it!

   You can view the details of bookmarks with `t'.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Using bookmarks for distributed development,  Next: Bookmarks groups,  Prev: Bookmarks basics,  Up: Using Bookmarks

1.2.6.2 Using bookmarks for distributed development
...................................................

Arch makes distributed development easy. Once you know that someone has
a patch for you in their archive, you can very easily merge it with tla
star-merge, or tla apply-changeset. But when several developers are
working on the same project, it's a pain to check manually the missing
patches in each archive.

   OK, we've got what you need!

   Add your own projects, and your contributors' projects too. Select
several related projects with `m' (unselect with `u' or `M-del'). Make
them partners with `M-p'. Now, with your cursor on a bookmark, view the
uncommited changes, the missing patches from your archive and from your
contributors with `M'. From this list, you will usually want to update
your tree if some changesets are missing from your own archive (This is
the `M u' keybinding), or star-merge from your contributors' archives
(This is the `. S' keybinding).

   In this list, DVC will also highlight revisions not merged by other
revisions. You can navigate through them with `N' and `P'. It is
recommended to merge these patches first, because merging a revision A,
and later merging a revision B which is a merge of A often results in
conflicts.

   Note that if you want to share your list of partners with all the
people having access to the project, you can just type `f w' to write
the list of parthers to the file `{arch}/=partner-versions', and your
partners will just have to type `f r' to read the list from this file.
Note that using this file, you will also be able to share your partner
list with `aba' users, and potentially others in the future.

   If you are managing several projects at the same time (or one real
project and several personal configuration directory), select several
bookmarks with `m', and type `M' to view all the missing patches from
all contributors.

   The idea is that you will usually want to leave your office in the
evening with an empty list here, and check for new items when you come
back in the morning.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Bookmarks groups,  Prev: Using bookmarks for distributed development,  Up: Using Bookmarks

1.2.6.3 Bookmarks groups
........................

Each bookmark can belong to a group of bookmarks. To make a group,
select some bookmarks, and hit `a g'. Enter a group name. The selected
bookmarks now belong to this group. To select a group, hit `* g' and
enter the group you want to select.

   Developers will typically have one group for all the projects he or
she has write access to (for example, group `mine'), and one group of
bookmarks for each projects, including his partners' projects (I have a
group `dvc'). Then, pressing `* g mine RET M' will show me all the
missing patches for my projects. `* g dvc RET M' will tell me if my
partners for `dvc' are up-to-date with my archive.

1.2.7 Transmit patches via email
--------------------------------

This section discusses a way to send/receive patches via email. That way
you can create patches for a project without the need to create a branch
for your contribution.

* Menu:

* Send patches via Gnus::
* Receive/Apply patches via Gnus::


File: dvc.info,  Node: Send patches via Gnus,  Next: Receive/Apply patches via Gnus,  Prev: Transmit patches via email,  Up: Transmit patches via email

1.2.7.1 Send patches via Gnus
.............................

When you are tracking a project via GNU Arch, you can just edit your
checked out working copy. When you have done that, just do `M-x
tla-submit-patch RET'.

   That command calculates a changeset for your changes. That changeset
is archived in a tarball and attached to a new created email.

   You can add a description of the changeset to the prepared email.
After you have entered your description, just send the mail.

   The variable tla-submit-patch-mapping allows you to specify a list of
rules to preselect the destination email address.

   The default setting for tla-submit-patch-mapping is here: `(((nil
"dvc" nil nil nil) ("dvc-el-dev@gna.org" "dvc")))'

   It defines, that every branch of the dvc project should submit
patches to `dvc-el-dev@gna.org'. The entry `"dvc"' just specifies, that
the filename for the patch should start with `dvc'.


File: dvc.info,  Node: Receive/Apply patches via Gnus,  Prev: Send patches via Gnus,  Up: Transmit patches via email

1.2.7.2 Receive/Apply patches via Gnus
......................................

To hook DVC to Gnus, put the following in your .emacs:
`(tla-insinuate-gnus)'

   Now the `K t' binding is available as prefix key in Gnus summary
buffers. This will also buttonize archives, categories, branches,
version and revision names in the `*article*' buffer.

   The two important commands are:
  1. `K t v': View the changeset

  2. `K t a': Apply the changeset to one of your working trees

   You can predefine the working tree, where you want to apply certain
kind of patches via tla-apply-patch-mapping.

   The follwing code specifies `"~/work/myprg/dvc-dev/"' as default
working tree for patches for the DVC project:

   `(setq tla-apply-patch-mapping       '(((nil "dvc" nil  nil nil)
"~/work/myprg/dvc-dev/")))'

   When you have applied the patch, you can commit the patch as usual.
The new keybinding `C-c C-p' inserts a log message that is extracted
from the received mail:
  1. The subject is used as the patch summary line

  2. The text between the log-start and the log-end markers in the mail
     specify the rest of the log message

1.3.2 Using DVC for star-shaped development
-------------------------------------------

By "star-shaped development", we mean a patch flow in which each
contributor only submit his patches to one version. This can be a
completely centralized solution, with one master version, or a
completely decentralized solution, with one master version for each
subprojects (potentially hierarchic), the main version for the full
project merging from the versions of the subprojects.

.......................................................

We call "maintainer" the person in charge of merging patches from
contributors in his archive. In the case of a subproject, the
maintainer for a subproject is also a contributor for the main project.

1.3.2.2 Getting the list of missing patches
...........................................

Unless merge requests are processed only on-demand, it is very usefull
to know the list of patches committed by your contributors that you
didn't merge already. This is done with the command `tla missing'.
Usually, there is a list of regular contributors from which you often
merge, and you may want to keep this list somewhere. In DVC, the best
way to do it is probably through bookmarks *Note Using bookmarks for
distributed development::, but you can also use the
`{arch}/=partner-versions' (or the precious version
`{arch}/+partner-versions') file for that: It is a list of newline
separated versions from which you often merge. The advantage of this
solution is that it is also implemented by aba and potentially other
tla front-ends in the future. Fortunately, you can keep it in sync with
your bookmarks from the bookmark buffer, with the key sequences `f w'
and `f r' (for respectively `tla-bookmarks-write-partners-to-file' and
`tla-bookmarks-add-partners-from-file').

   You can also run `C-u M-x tla-missing RET' to view manually the list
of missing patches for a given version, off course, and you can use the
keybindings available in the name reading engine (Get the list with
`C-h') to get quickly the fully qualified version name of a contributor.

1.3.2.3 Reviewing patches before merging them
.............................................

A good maintainer should never merge patches blindly.

   From a revision list buffer, `RET' will open the log file, `=' will
display the changeset.

   If you are unsure about something, or whish to reject the patch, type
`M-x tla-revision-send-comments RET' to send a mail to the author of
the patch.

   The usual way to merge is to put your cursor on the patch up to which
you want to merge, and type `. s' to "star-merge" the patches from the
common ancestor to this one. Other merge operators are available. `C-h
m' and the menubar will give you a list.

   You can use "sync-tree" to reject a patch: After merging patches up
to the direct ancestor of the patch to be rejected, type `M-x
tla-revision-sync-tree RET'.

1.3.2.4 Generating patch-logs after merging
...........................................

DVC can generate the log file automatically after a merge. Just try
`C-c C-m' in the log buffer. This will generate the body (using `tla
log-for-merge'), and a summary line is also generated. The default
format for the summary line should be good for a simple contributor,
but it is highy recommanded to change it if you are the maintainer: The
simplest way to do it is to set the `summary-format' field for the
bookmark corresponding to the version you're managing (just type `s' on
the bookmark of your choice in the bookmark buffer). A typical value
would be `" [%s]"': The generated summary line will then look like


Summary:  [mark@dishevelled.net--2003-mst (patch 6-8)]

   That you can complete manually to something like


Summary: Bugfix for regression tests [mark@dishevelled.net--2003-mst (patch 6-8)]

   More customization can be done: see the docstring for the variable

1.4 Trouble Shooting
====================

Due to some reasons TLA might fail. In order to investigate the reason
you can switch to the buffers containing TLA output. Switch to the `
*tla-logs' buffer (you can do that with
`tla-open-internal-log-buffer'). You get the list of processes that
have been ran since Emacs was started. Navigate with `n' and `p', and
swith to the corresponding process buffer with `RET', to the error
buffer with `e', and to the buffer from which the process was started
with `r'. Note that the process and output buffers are killed after
some time if the variable `tla-number-of-dead-process-buffer' is
non-nil. You also have a `Tla-Buffers' menu item in the `DVC' menu, on
in your menu-bar on arch-related buffers to navigate between those.

   If you encounter an internal lisp error, enable backtrace generation
by `M-x toggle-debug-on-error' and reproduce the error.  Now submit a
bug report with `M-x dvc-submit-bug-report' and ensure the content of
the buffer `*Backtrace*' is included.

numbers of DVC and tla and how to reproduce the bug.  Further the
content of process buffers or in case of a lisp error a backtrace might
be helpful, see *Note Trouble Shooting::. on how to get it.

   Please use `M-x dvc-submit-bug-report RET' for submitting or at least
to get a template for the report which you copy to your favorite MUA.
