Subject: Xtla 1.2 is out!!

The Xtla development team is proud to announce the release of Xtla,
version 1.2.

Xtla is the Emacs front-end to GNU Arch client (either tla or bazaar
branch, at your option). It mainly provides user-friendly wrappers for
native commands.

The 1.2 version of Xtla will most probably be the last version of Xtla
to contain new features. We are currently moving to a more generic
architecture, that we called DVC, which will support other RCS as
back-ends. We already have preliminary support for Mercurial and
Bazaar 2.

The main features are:

  * PCL-CVS like interface for tla inventory and tla changes

  * Archive browser - navigate painlessly through archives, categories,
    branches, versions, etc.

  * Good integration in Emacs - almost everything can be done from
    within the editor

  * Bookmark manager - keep the most frequently used arch locations in
    your bookmark buffer

  * Integration with ediff, Emacs's graphical diff tool
      - to view changes made in a local tree.
      - to view and resolve conflicts after a merge.

  * Interface to view missing patches from all your partners with a
    single command

  * An Emacs mode for arch-related files (log files, =tagging-method,
    "build-config" files)

  * Support for baz, and for baz added commands like "switch",
    "annotate", "status", "resolved"

  * Integraton with Gnus.

The main new features for the 1.2 version are:

  * M-x baz-update RET can use either merge, replay, or update

  * changelog buffer, cat-log-mode buffers, and *Article* buffers (in
    Gnus) show clickable buttons for revision names (and other Arch
    names).

  * A mail notification is available from the Changelog buffer (bound
    to "M")

  * Several bazaaz 1.5 compatibility issues solved

  * Many bugfixes
