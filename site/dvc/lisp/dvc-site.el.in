;;; Commentary:

;; Variables tla-*** of dvc-defs.el and other *-defs.el for which the
;; configure script can provide a value have their tla-site-*** dual
;; here. It is set by configure, and will be used as default value in
;; dvc-defs.el

;;; Code:

(defvar dvc-site-tla-executable "@TLA@")
(defvar dvc-site-baz-executable "@BAZ@")
(defvar dvc-site-diff-executable "@DIFF@")
(defvar dvc-site-patch-executable "@PATCH@")
(defvar dvc-site-arch-branch '@ARCH_BRANCH@)

(provide 'dvc-site)
