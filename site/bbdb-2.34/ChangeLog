	* testing/bbdb-test.el:
	  New file

	* bits/make.bat:
	  Merged in some changes from the mailing list. Note, this is
	  still experimental.

	  Don't fset things that aren't ours
	  Last of compiler warning cleanup

	  Changed the workaround for set-keymap-prompt, as it seemed to be
	  clashing with VM. Ideally, all this Emacs/XEmacs stuff should go
	  in a separate file, or at least all in one part of bbdb.el.

2001-12-10  Karl Fogel <kfogel@red-bean.com>

	* bbdb.texinfo
	(Mail Sending Interfaces):
	Use `add-hook' instead of `setq' in the examples, so users won't
	clobber existing hooks.

	* lisp/bbdb-com.el

	Restored the original code to handle making sure primary addresses
	get picked first, since the code I'd replaced it with had some
	dubious side-effects.
	(bbdb-create-internal):
	Documentation fix. (Ueli Schläpfer)

2001-09-20  Robert Fenk  <Robert.Fenk@gmx.de>

	bbdb-update-address-class and bbdb-update-address-header to obtain
	information about the currently processed email address.

	* lisp/bbdb-com.el (bbdb-get-addresses-headers): merged 
	bbdb-get-addresses-from-headers  and bbdb-get-addresses-to-headers
	into this variable.
	(bbdb-get-addresses): new generic function for extraction of email
	addresses from header, which is used by Gnus and VM
	(bbdb-update-address-class), (bbdb-update-address-header): new
	variable providing additional information to hook functions about
	the currently processed email address.
	
	* lisp/bbdb-gnus.el (bbdb/gnus-update-records): uses
	bbdb-get-addresses instead of bbdb/gnus-get-addresses which was
	removed.

	* lisp/bbdb-com.el (bbdb-get-addresses-headers):
	bbdb-auto-notes-alist does not know if a address comes form a
	author or recipient of a message and therefore might update wrong
	records, e.g. the organization of recipients to that of the
	author.
	Therfore the default is now bbdb-get-addresses-from-headers until
	the hook functions are able to tell the type (author/recp) of an
	address.

	* lisp/Makefile.in
	Added Makefile target
	Call expand-file-name when building load-path

	force, but does a pretty good job.

	Fixed some comment and documentation typos.

	use of these functions, please cast enlightenment in my direction.

	* lisp/bbdb-gnus.el:
	Rearranged the compiled quieting to actually be more-or-less the right
	thing, i.e. it loads packages instead of defining arbitrary
	variables.

	Put in Matan Ninio's "From: " fix.

	* lisp/bbdb.el:
	bbdb-search-simple: don't use bbdb-record-name's result if it's empty.

	* html/index.html:
	Fix to yesterday's fixed URL. Not my fault, honest.

	* bbdb/html/faq.html:
	Initial cut. This has been sitting on my drive for almost a year;

2001-06-11  Waider  <waider@waider.ie>

	* lisp/bbdb-com.el:

	    CODE AGAINST BOTH EMACS VARIANTS BEFORE CHECKING IT IN.
	* (bbdb-address-edit-default): 
	  If no data is entered for the address, enter a spurious country
	    name. This is a temporary hack to get around a problem in
	    address display when the address has no data. 
        * (general)
	  Fixed the occasional documentation typo.
	  Added completion for Phone and Address labels.
	  Added bbdb-default-country as an attempt to stop you from

	* lisp/bbdb.el (bbdb-join): dropped an unused variable
	(save-current-buffer): fset to `save-excursion' if not present

	handling of "*" in order to delete multiple records and 'noprompt'.
	(bbdb-send-mail-internal): added missing call of vm hooks.

	bbdb-extract-address-components to extract all recipients and uses
	vm-summary-uninteresting-senders for ignoring senders, which is

	order.
	(bbdb/vm-message-cache-lookup):

	instead of the bbdb default functions since we are handling a set

	(bbdb/vm-update-record): is now just a call to
	(bbdb/vm-update-records): which performs the actual work of
	finding and updating records.
