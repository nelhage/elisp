Minor mode to send every kill from a TTY frame to the system clipboard.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Clipetty
mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `clipetty-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

(defvar global-clipetty-mode nil "\
Non-nil if Global Clipetty mode is enabled.
See the `global-clipetty-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `global-clipetty-mode'.")

(autoload 'global-clipetty-mode "clipetty" "\
Toggle Clipetty mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global Clipetty mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.
Enable the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

Clipetty mode is enabled in all buffers where `(lambda nil
(clipetty-mode 1))' would do it.

See `clipetty-mode' for more information on Clipetty mode.

It can be annoying to have Clipetty overwrite your system
clipboard every time you kill something.  This function wraps
Clipetty around the `kill-ring-save' function and can be invoked
explicitly." t)
