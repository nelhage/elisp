Transient User and Developer Manual
***********************************

Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
“transient command”, but because it always involves at least two
commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
“transient”.

   When the user calls a transient prefix command, a transient
(temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient’s infix and
suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state are
added to ‘pre-command-hook’ and ‘post-command-hook’.  The available
suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in a popup buffer
until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix command.

   Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly by
reading a new value in the minibuffer.

   Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited
but suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the transient.

     The second part of this manual, which describes how to modify
     existing transients and create new transients from scratch, can be
     hard to digest if you are just getting started.  A useful resource
     to get over that hurdle is Psionic K’s interactive tutorial,
     available at
     <https://github.com/positron-solutions/transient-showcase>.

This manual is for Transient version 0.3.7.50-git.

1 Introduction
**************

Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
“transient command”, but because it always involves at least two
commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
“transient”.

     Transient keymaps are a feature provided by Emacs.  Transients as
     implemented by this package involve the use of transient keymaps.

     Emacs provides a feature that it calls “prefix commands”.  When we
     talk about “prefix commands” in this manual, then we mean our own
     kind of “prefix commands”, unless specified otherwise.  To avoid
     ambiguity we sometimes use the terms “transient prefix command” for
     our kind and “regular prefix command” for Emacs’ kind.

   When the user calls a transient prefix command, a transient
(temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient’s infix and
suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state are
added to ‘pre-command-hook’ and ‘post-command-hook’.  The available
suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in a popup buffer
until the transient state is exited by invoking a suffix command.

   Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed.  How that is
done depends on the type of the infix command.  The simplest case is an
infix command that represents a command-line argument that does not take
a value.  Invoking such an infix command causes the switch to be toggled
on or off.  More complex infix commands may read a value from the user,
using the minibuffer.

   Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited;
the transient keymaps and hook functions are removed, the popup buffer
no longer shows information about the (no longer bound) suffix commands,
the values of some public global variables are set, while some internal
global variables are unset, and finally the command is actually called.
Suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the transient.

   A suffix command can, but does not have to, use the infix arguments
in much the same way any command can choose to use or ignore the prefix
arguments.  For a suffix command that was invoked from a transient, the
variable ‘transient-current-suffixes’ and the function ‘transient-args’
serve about the same purpose as the variables ‘prefix-arg’ and
‘current-prefix-arg’ do for any command that was called after the prefix
arguments have been set using a command such as ‘universal-argument’.

   The information shown in the popup buffer while a transient is active
looks a bit like this:

     ,-----------------------------------------
     |Arguments
     | -f Force (--force)
     | -a Annotate (--annotate)
     |
     |Create
     | t tag
     | r release
     `-----------------------------------------

     This is a simplified version of ‘magit-tag’.  Info manuals do not
     support images or colored text, so the above “screenshot” lacks
     some information; in practice you would be able to tell whether the
     arguments ‘--force’ and ‘--annotate’ are enabled or not based on
     their color.

   Transient can be used to implement simple “command dispatchers”.  The
main benefit then is that the user can see all the available commands in
a popup buffer.  That is useful by itself because it frees the user from
having to remember all the keys that are valid after a certain prefix
key or command.  Magit’s ‘magit-dispatch’ (on ‘C-x M-g’) command is an
example of using Transient to merely implement a command dispatcher.

   In addition to that, Transient also allows users to interactively
pass arguments to commands.  These arguments can be much more complex
than what is reasonable when using prefix arguments.  There is a limit
to how many aspects of a command can be controlled using prefix
arguments.  Furthermore, what a certain prefix argument means for
different commands can be completely different, and users have to read
documentation to learn and then commit to memory what a certain prefix
argument means to a certain command.

   Transient suffix commands, on the other hand, can accept dozens of
different arguments without the user having to remember anything.  When
using Transient, one can call a command with arguments that are just as
complex as when calling the same function non-interactively from Lisp.

   Invoking a transient command with arguments is similar to invoking a
command in a shell with command-line completion and history enabled.
One benefit of the Transient interface is that it remembers history not
only on a global level (“this command was invoked using these arguments,
and previously it was invoked using those other arguments”), but also
remembers the values of individual arguments independently.  See *note
Using History::.

   After a transient prefix command is invoked, ‘C-h KEY’ can be used to
show the documentation for the infix or suffix command that KEY is bound
to (see *note Getting Help for Suffix Commands::), and infixes and
suffixes can be removed from the transient using ‘C-x l KEY’.  Infixes
and suffixes that are disabled by default can be enabled the same way.
See *note Enabling and Disabling Suffixes::.

   Transient ships with support for a few different types of specialized
infix commands.  A command that sets a command line option, for example,
has different needs than a command that merely toggles a boolean flag.
Additionally, Transient provides abstractions for defining new types,
which the author of Transient did not anticipate (or didn’t get around
to implementing yet).

2.1 Invoking Transients
=======================

A transient prefix command is invoked like any other command by pressing
the key that is bound to that command.  The main difference to other
commands is that a transient prefix command activates a transient
keymap, which temporarily binds the transient’s infix and suffix
commands.  Bindings from other keymaps may, or may not, be disabled
while the transient state is in effect.

   There are two kinds of commands that are available after invoking a
transient prefix command; infix and suffix commands.  Infix commands set
some value (which is then shown in a popup buffer), without leaving the
transient.  Suffix commands, on the other hand, usually quit the
transient and they may use the values set by the infix commands, i.e.,
the infix *arguments*.

   Instead of setting arguments to be used by a suffix command, infix
commands may also set some value by side-effect, e.g., by setting the
value of some variable.


File: transient.info,  Node: Aborting and Resuming Transients,  Next: Common Suffix Commands,  Prev: Invoking Transients,  Up: Usage

2.2 Aborting and Resuming Transients
====================================

To quit the transient without invoking a suffix command press ‘C-g’.

   Key bindings in transient keymaps may be longer than a single event.
After pressing a valid prefix key, all commands whose bindings do not
begin with that prefix key are temporarily unavailable and grayed out.
To abort the prefix key press ‘C-g’ (which in this case only quits the
prefix key, but not the complete transient).

   A transient prefix command can be bound as a suffix of another
transient.  Invoking such a suffix replaces the current transient state
with a new transient state, i.e., the available bindings change and the
information displayed in the popup buffer is updated accordingly.
Pressing ‘C-g’ while a nested transient is active only quits the
innermost transient, causing a return to the previous transient.

   ‘C-q’ or ‘C-z’ on the other hand always exits all transients.  If you
use the latter, then you can later resume the stack of transients using
‘M-x transient-resume’.

‘C-g’ (‘transient-quit-seq’)
‘C-g’ (‘transient-quit-one’)
     This key quits the currently active incomplete key sequence, if
     any, or else the current transient.  When quitting the current
     transient, it returns to the previous transient, if any.

   Transient’s predecessor bound ‘q’ instead of ‘C-g’ to the quit
command.  To learn how to get that binding back see
‘transient-bind-q-to-quit’’s doc string.

‘C-q’ (‘transient-quit-all’)
     This command quits the currently active incomplete key sequence, if
     any, and all transients, including the active transient and all
     suspended transients, if any.

‘C-z’ (‘transient-suspend’)
     Like ‘transient-quit-all’, this command quits an incomplete key
     sequence, if any, and all transients.  Additionally, it saves the
     stack of transients so that it can easily be resumed (which is
     particularly useful if you quickly need to do “something else” and
     the stack is deeper than a single transient, and/or you have
     already changed the values of some infix arguments).

     Note that only a single stack of transients can be saved at a time.
     If another stack is already saved, then saving a new stack discards
     the previous stack.

‘M-x transient-resume’
     This command resumes the previously suspended stack of transients,
     if any.


File: transient.info,  Node: Common Suffix Commands,  Next: Saving Values,  Prev: Aborting and Resuming Transients,  Up: Usage

2.3 Common Suffix Commands
==========================

A few shared suffix commands are available in all transients.  These
suffix commands are not shown in the popup buffer by default.

   This includes the aborting commands mentioned in the previous
section, as well as some other commands that are all bound to ‘C-x KEY’.
After ‘C-x’ is pressed, a section featuring all these common commands is
temporarily shown in the popup buffer.  After invoking one of them, the
section disappears again.  Note, however, that one of these commands is
described as “Show common permanently”; invoke that if you want the
common commands to always be shown for all transients.

‘C-x t’ (‘transient-toggle-common’)
     This command toggles whether the generic commands that are common
     to all transients are always displayed or only after typing the
     incomplete prefix key sequence ‘C-x’.  This only affects the
     current Emacs session.

 -- User Option: transient-show-common-commands
     This option controls whether shared suffix commands are shown
     alongside the transient-specific infix and suffix commands.  By
     default, the shared commands are not shown to avoid overwhelming
     the user with too many options.

     While a transient is active, pressing ‘C-x’ always shows the common
     commands.  The value of this option can be changed for the current
     Emacs session by typing ‘C-x t’ while a transient is active.

   The other common commands are described in either the previous or in
one of the following sections.

   Some of Transient’s key bindings differ from the respective bindings
of Magit-Popup; see *note FAQ:: for more information.


File: transient.info,  Node: Saving Values,  Next: Using History,  Prev: Common Suffix Commands,  Up: Usage

2.4 Saving Values
=================

After setting the infix arguments in a transient, the user can save
those arguments for future invocations.

   Most transients will start out with the saved arguments when they are
invoked.  There are a few exceptions, though.  Some transients are
designed so that the value that they use is stored externally as the
buffer-local value of some variable.  Invoking such a transient again
uses the buffer-local value.  (1)

   If the user does not save the value and just exits using a regular
suffix command, then the value is merely saved to the transient’s
history.  That value won’t be used when the transient is next invoked,
but it is easily accessible (see *note Using History::).

‘C-x s’ (‘transient-set’)
     This command saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs
     session.

‘C-x C-s’ (‘transient-save’)
     Save the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs
     sessions.

‘C-x C-k’ (‘transient-reset’)
     Clear the set and saved values of the active transient.

 -- User Option: transient-values-file
     This option names the file that is used to persist the values of
     transients between Emacs sessions.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) ‘magit-diff’ and ‘magit-log’ are two prominent examples, and
their handling of buffer-local values is actually a bit more complicated
than outlined above and even customizable.


File: transient.info,  Node: Using History,  Next: Getting Help for Suffix Commands,  Prev: Saving Values,  Up: Usage

2.5 Using History
=================

Every time the user invokes a suffix command the transient’s current
value is saved to its history.  These values can be cycled through the
same way one can cycle through the history of commands that read
user-input in the minibuffer.

‘C-M-p’ (‘transient-history-prev’)
‘C-x p’
     This command switches to the previous value used for the active
     transient.

‘C-M-n’ (‘transient-history-next’)
‘C-x n’
     This command switches to the next value used for the active
     transient.

   In addition to the transient-wide history, Transient of course
supports per-infix history.  When an infix reads user-input using the
minibuffer, the user can use the regular minibuffer history commands to
cycle through previously used values.  Usually the same keys as those
mentioned above are bound to those commands.

   Authors of transients should arrange for different infix commands
that read the same kind of value to also use the same history key (see
*note Suffix Slots::).

   Both kinds of history are saved to a file when Emacs is exited.

 -- User Option: transient-history-file
     This option names the file that is used to persist the history of
     transients and their infixes between Emacs sessions.

 -- User Option: transient-history-limit
     This option controls how many history elements are kept at the time
     the history is saved in ‘transient-history-file’.


File: transient.info,  Node: Getting Help for Suffix Commands,  Next: Enabling and Disabling Suffixes,  Prev: Using History,  Up: Usage

2.6 Getting Help for Suffix Commands
====================================

Transients can have many suffixes and infixes that the user might not be
familiar with.  To make it trivial to get help for these, Transient
provides access to the documentation directly from the active transient.

‘C-h’ (‘transient-help’)
     This command enters help mode.  When help mode is active, typing a
     key shows information about the suffix command that the key
     normally is bound to (instead of invoking it).  Pressing ‘C-h’ a
     second time shows information about the _prefix_ command.

     After typing a key, the stack of transient states is suspended and
     information about the suffix command is shown instead.  Typing ‘q’
     in the help buffer buries that buffer and resumes the transient
     state.

   What sort of documentation is shown depends on how the transient was
defined.  For infix commands that represent command-line arguments this
ideally shows the appropriate manpage.  ‘transient-help’ then tries to
jump to the correct location within that.  Info manuals are also
supported.  The fallback is to show the command’s doc string, for
non-infix suffixes this is usually appropriate.

2.7 Enabling and Disabling Suffixes
===================================

The user base of a package that uses transients can be very diverse.
This is certainly the case for Magit; some users have been using it and
Git for a decade, while others are just getting started now.

   For that reason a mechanism is needed that authors can use to
classify a transient’s infixes and suffixes along the
essentials...everything spectrum.  We use the term “levels” to describe
that mechanism.

   Each suffix command is placed on a level and each transient has a
level (called “transient-level”), which controls which suffix commands
are available.  Integers between 1 and 7 (inclusive) are valid levels.
For suffixes, 0 is also valid; it means that the suffix is not displayed
at any level.

   The levels of individual transients and/or their individual suffixes
can be changed interactively, by invoking the transient and then
pressing ‘C-x l’ to enter the “edit” mode, see below.

   The default level for both transients and their suffixes is 4.  The
‘transient-default-level’ option only controls the default for
transients.  The default suffix level is always 4.  The authors of
transients should place certain suffixes on a higher level, if they
expect that it won’t be of use to most users, and they should place very
important suffixes on a lower level, so that they remain available even
if the user lowers the transient level.

 -- User Option: transient-default-level
     This option controls which suffix levels are made available by
     default.  It sets the transient-level for transients for which the
     user has not set that individually.

 -- User Option: transient-levels-file
     This option names the file that is used to persist the levels of
     transients and their suffixes between Emacs sessions.

‘C-x l’ (‘transient-set-level’)
     This command enters edit mode.  When edit mode is active, then all
     infixes and suffixes that are currently usable are displayed along
     with their levels.  The colors of the levels indicate whether they
     are enabled or not.  The level of the transient is also displayed
     along with some usage information.

     In edit mode, pressing the key that would usually invoke a certain
     suffix instead prompts the user for the level that suffix should be
     placed on.

     Help mode is available in edit mode.

     To change the transient level press ‘C-x l’ again.

     To exit edit mode press ‘C-g’.

     Note that edit mode does not display any suffixes that are not
     currently usable.  ‘magit-rebase’, for example, shows different
     suffixes depending on whether a rebase is already in progress or
     not.  The predicates also apply in edit mode.

     Therefore, to control which suffixes are available given a certain
     state, you have to make sure that that state is currently active.

2.8 Other Commands
==================

When invoking a transient in a small frame, the transient window may not
show the complete buffer, making it necessary to scroll, using the
following commands.  These commands are never shown in the transient
window, and the key bindings are the same as for ‘scroll-up-command’ and
‘scroll-down-command’ in other buffers.

 -- Command: transient-scroll-up arg
     This command scrolls text of transient popup window upward ARG
     lines.  If ARG is ‘nil’, then it scrolls near full screen.  This is
     a wrapper around ‘scroll-up-command’ (which see).

 -- Command: transient-scroll-down arg
     This command scrolls text of transient popup window down ARG lines.
     If ARG is ‘nil’, then it scrolls near full screen.  This is a
     wrapper around ‘scroll-down-command’ (which see).


File: transient.info,  Node: Configuration,  Prev: Other Commands,  Up: Usage

2.9 Configuration
=================

More options are described in *note Common Suffix Commands::, in *note
Saving Values::, in *note Using History:: and in *note Enabling and
Disabling Suffixes::.

Essential Options
-----------------

Also see *note Common Suffix Commands::.

 -- User Option: transient-show-popup
     This option controls whether the current transient’s infix and
     suffix commands are shown in the popup buffer.

        • If ‘t’ (the default) then the popup buffer is shown as soon as
          a transient prefix command is invoked.

        • If ‘nil’, then the popup buffer is not shown unless the user
          explicitly requests it, by pressing an incomplete prefix key
          sequence.

        • If a number, then the a brief one-line summary is shown
          instead of the popup buffer.  If zero or negative, then not
          even that summary is shown; only the pressed key itself is
          shown.

          The popup is shown when the user explicitly requests it by
          pressing an incomplete prefix key sequence.  Unless this is
          zero, the popup is shown after that many seconds of inactivity
          (using the absolute value).

 -- User Option: transient-enable-popup-navigation
     This option controls whether navigation commands are enabled in the
     transient popup buffer.

     While a transient is active the transient popup buffer is not the
     current buffer, making it necessary to use dedicated commands to
     act on that buffer itself.  This is disabled by default.  If this
     option is non-‘nil’, then the following features are available:

        • ‘<UP>’ moves the cursor to the previous suffix.
        • ‘<DOWN>’ moves the cursor to the next suffix.
        • ‘<RET>’ invokes the suffix the cursor is on.
        • ‘mouse-1’ invokes the clicked on suffix.
        • ‘C-s’ and ‘C-r’ start isearch in the popup buffer.

 -- User Option: transient-display-buffer-action
     This option specifies the action used to display the transient
     popup buffer.  The transient popup buffer is displayed in a window
     using ‘(display-buffer BUFFER transient-display-buffer-action)’.

     The value of this option has the form ‘(FUNCTION . ALIST)’, where
     FUNCTION is a function or a list of functions.  Each such function
     should accept two arguments: a buffer to display and an alist of
     the same form as ALIST.  See *note (elisp)Choosing Window::, for
     details.

     The default is:

          (display-buffer-in-side-window
            (side . bottom)
            (inhibit-same-window . t)
            (window-parameters (no-other-window . t)))

     This displays the window at the bottom of the selected frame.
     Another useful FUNCTION is ‘display-buffer-below-selected’, which
     is what ‘magit-popup’ used by default.  For more alternatives see
     *note (elisp)Buffer Display Action Functions::, and *note
     (elisp)Buffer Display Action Alists::.

     Note that the buffer that was current before the transient buffer
     is shown should remain the current buffer.  Many suffix commands
     act on the thing at point, if appropriate, and if the transient
     buffer became the current buffer, then that would change what is at
     point.  To that effect ‘inhibit-same-window’ ensures that the
     selected window is not used to show the transient buffer.

     It may be possible to display the window in another frame, but
     whether that works in practice depends on the window-manager.  If
     the window manager selects the new window (Emacs frame), then that
     unfortunately changes which buffer is current.

     If you change the value of this option, then you might also want to
     change the value of ‘transient-mode-line-format’.

Accessibility Options
---------------------

 -- User Option: transient-force-single-column
     This option controls whether the use of a single column to display
     suffixes is enforced.  This might be useful for users with low
     vision who use large text and might otherwise have to scroll in two
     dimensions.

Auxiliary Options
-----------------

 -- User Option: transient-mode-line-format
     This option controls whether the transient popup buffer has a
     mode-line, separator line, or neither.

     If ‘nil’, then the buffer has no mode-line.  If the buffer is not
     displayed right above the echo area, then this probably is not a
     good value.

     If ‘line’ (the default), then the buffer also has no mode-line, but
     a thin line is drawn instead, using the background color of the
     face ‘transient-separator’.  Text-mode frames cannot display thin
     lines, and therefore fall back to treating ‘line’ like ‘nil’.

     Otherwise this can be any mode-line format.  See *note (elisp)Mode
     Line Format::, for details.

 -- User Option: transient-semantic-coloring
     This option controls whether prefixes and suffixes are colored in a
     Hydra-like fashion.

     If non-‘nil’, then the key binding of each suffix is colorized to
     indicate whether it exits the transient state or not.  The color of
     the prefix is indicated using the line that is drawn when the value
     of ‘transient-mode-line-format’ is ‘line’.

 -- User Option: transient-highlight-mismatched-keys
     This option controls whether key bindings of infix commands that do
     not match the respective command-line argument should be
     highlighted.  For other infix commands this option has no effect.

     When this option is non-‘nil’, the key binding for an infix
     argument is highlighted when only a long argument (e.g.,
     ‘--verbose’) is specified but no shorthand (e.g., ‘-v’).  In the
     rare case that a shorthand is specified but the key binding does
     not match, then it is highlighted differently.

     Highlighting mismatched key bindings is useful when learning the
     arguments of the underlying command-line tool; you wouldn’t want to
     learn any short-hands that do not actually exist.

     The highlighting is done using one of the faces
     ‘transient-mismatched-key’ and ‘transient-nonstandard-key’.

 -- User Option: transient-substitute-key-function
     This function is used to modify key bindings.  If the value of this
     option is ‘nil’ (the default), then no substitution is performed.

     This function is called with one argument, the prefix object, and
     must return a key binding description, either the existing key
     description it finds in the ‘key’ slot, or the key description that
     replaces the prefix key.  It could be used to make other
     substitutions, but that is discouraged.

     For example, ‘=’ is hard to reach using my custom keyboard layout,
     so I substitute ‘(’ for that, which is easy to reach using a layout
     optimized for lisp.

          (setq transient-substitute-key-function
                (lambda (obj)
                  (let ((key (oref obj key)))
                    (if (string-match "\\`\\(=\\)[a-zA-Z]" key)
                        (replace-match "(" t t key 1)
                      key))))

 -- User Option: transient-read-with-initial-input
     This option controls whether the last history element is used as
     the initial minibuffer input when reading the value of an infix
     argument from the user.  If ‘nil’, there is no initial input and
     the first element has to be accessed the same way as the older
     elements.

 -- User Option: transient-hide-during-minibuffer-read
     This option controls whether the transient buffer is hidden while
     user input is being read in the minibuffer.

 -- User Option: transient-align-variable-pitch
     This option controls whether columns are aligned pixel-wise in the
     popup buffer.

     If this is non-‘nil’, then columns are aligned pixel-wise to
     support variable-pitch fonts.  Keys are not aligned, so you should
     use a fixed-pitch font for the ‘transient-key’ face.  Other key
     faces inherit from that face unless a theme is used that breaks
     that relationship.

     This option is intended for users who use a variable-pitch font for
     the ‘default’ face.

 -- User Option: transient-force-fixed-pitch
     This option controls whether to force the use of a monospaced font
     in popup buffer.  Even if you use a proportional font for the
     ‘default’ face, you might still want to use a monospaced font in
     transient’s popup buffer.  Setting this option to ‘t’ causes
     ‘default’ to be remapped to ‘fixed-pitch’ in that buffer.

Developer Options
-----------------

These options are mainly intended for developers.

 -- User Option: transient-detect-key-conflicts
     This option controls whether key binding conflicts should be
     detected at the time the transient is invoked.  If so, this results
     in an error, which prevents the transient from being used.  Because
     of that, conflicts are ignored by default.

     Conflicts cannot be determined earlier, i.e., when the transient is
     being defined and when new suffixes are being added, because at
     that time there can be false-positives.  It is actually valid for
     multiple suffixes to share a common key binding, provided the
     predicates of those suffixes prevent that more than one of them is
     enabled at a time.

 -- User Option: transient-highlight-higher-levels
     This option controls whether suffixes that would not be available
     by default are highlighted.

     When non-‘nil’ then the descriptions of suffixes are highlighted if
     their level is above 4, the default of ‘transient-default-level’.
     Assuming you have set that variable to 7, this highlights all
     suffixes that won’t be available to users without them making the
     same customization.

3 Modifying Existing Transients
*******************************

To an extent, transients can be customized interactively, see *note
Enabling and Disabling Suffixes::.  This section explains how existing
transients can be further modified non-interactively.  Let’s begin with
an example:

     (transient-append-suffix 'magit-patch-apply "-3"
       '("-R" "Apply in reverse" "--reverse"))

   This inserts a new infix argument to toggle the ‘--reverse’ argument
after the infix argument that toggles ‘-3’ in ‘magit-patch-apply’.

   The following functions share a few arguments:

   • PREFIX is a transient prefix command, a symbol.

   • SUFFIX is a transient infix or suffix specification in the same
     form as expected by ‘transient-define-prefix’.  Note that an infix
     is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context “suffixes” means
     “suffixes (including infixes)” or “non-infix suffixes”.  Here it
     means the former.  See *note Suffix Specifications::.

     SUFFIX may also be a group in the same form as expected by
     ‘transient-define-prefix’.  See *note Group Specifications::.

   • LOC is a command, a key vector, a key description (a string as
     returned by ‘key-description’), or a list specifying coordinates
     (the last element may also be a command or key).  For example ‘(1 0
     -1)’ identifies the last suffix (‘-1’) of the first subgroup (‘0’)
     of the second group (‘1’).

     If LOC is a list of coordinates, then it can be used to identify a
     group, not just an individual suffix command.

     The function ‘transient-get-suffix’ can be useful to determine
     whether a certain coordination list identifies the suffix or group
     that you expect it to identify.  In hairy cases it may be necessary
     to look at the definition of the transient prefix command.

   These functions operate on the information stored in the
‘transient--layout’ property of the PREFIX symbol.  Suffix entries in
that tree are not objects but have the form ‘(LEVEL CLASS PLIST)’, where
PLIST should set at least ‘:key’, ‘:description’ and ‘:command’.

 -- Function: transient-insert-suffix prefix loc suffix &optional
          keep-other
 -- Function: transient-append-suffix prefix loc suffix &optional
          keep-other
     These functions insert the suffix or group SUFFIX into PREFIX
     before or after LOC.

     Conceptually adding a binding to a transient prefix is similar to
     adding a binding to a keymap, but this is complicated by the fact
     that multiple suffix commands can be bound to the same key,
     provided they are never active at the same time, see *note
     Predicate Slots::.

     Unfortunately both false-positives and false-negatives are
     possible.  To deal with the former use non-‘nil’ KEEP-OTHER.  To
     deal with the latter remove the conflicting binding explicitly.

 -- Function: transient-replace-suffix prefix loc suffix
     This function replaces the suffix or group at LOC in PREFIX with
     suffix or group SUFFIX.

 -- Function: transient-remove-suffix prefix loc
     This function removes the suffix or group at LOC in PREFIX.

 -- Function: transient-get-suffix prefix loc
     This function returns the suffix or group at LOC in PREFIX.  The
     returned value has the form mentioned above.

 -- Function: transient-suffix-put prefix loc prop value
     This function edits the suffix or group at LOC in PREFIX, by
     setting the PROP of its plist to VALUE.

   Most of these functions do not signal an error if they cannot perform
the requested modification.  The functions that insert new suffixes show
a warning if LOC cannot be found in PREFIX without signaling an error.
The reason for doing it like this is that establishing a key binding
(and that is what we essentially are trying to do here) should not
prevent the rest of the configuration from loading.  Among these
functions only ‘transient-get-suffix’ and ‘transient-suffix-put’ may
signal an error.

4.1 Defining Transients
=======================

A transient consists of a prefix command and at least one suffix
command, though usually a transient has several infix and suffix
commands.  The below macro defines the transient prefix command *and*
binds the transient’s infix and suffix commands.  In other words, it
defines the complete transient, not just the transient prefix command
that is used to invoke that transient.

 -- Macro: transient-define-prefix name arglist [docstring] [keyword
          value]... group... [body...]
     This macro defines NAME as a transient prefix command and binds the
     transient’s infix and suffix commands.

     ARGLIST are the arguments that the prefix command takes.  DOCSTRING
     is the documentation string and is optional.

     These arguments can optionally be followed by keyword-value pairs.
     Each key has to be a keyword symbol, either ‘:class’ or a keyword
     argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
     ‘transient-prefix’ class is used if the class is not specified
     explicitly.

     GROUPs add key bindings for infix and suffix commands and specify
     how these bindings are presented in the popup buffer.  At least one
     GROUP has to be specified.  See *note Binding Suffix and Infix
     Commands::.

     The BODY is optional.  If it is omitted, then ARGLIST is ignored
     and the function definition becomes:

          (lambda ()
            (interactive)
            (transient-setup 'NAME))

     If BODY is specified, then it must begin with an ‘interactive’ form
     that matches ARGLIST, and it must call ‘transient-setup’.  It may,
     however, call that function only when some condition is satisfied.

     All transients have a (possibly ‘nil’) value, which is exported
     when suffix commands are called, so that they can consume that
     value.  For some transients it might be necessary to have a sort of
     secondary value, called a “scope”.  Such a scope would usually be
     set in the command’s ‘interactive’ form and has to be passed to the
     setup function:

          (transient-setup 'NAME nil nil :scope SCOPE)

     For example, the scope of the ‘magit-branch-configure’ transient is
     the branch whose variables are being configured.

4.2 Binding Suffix and Infix Commands
=====================================

The macro ‘transient-define-prefix’ is used to define a transient.  This
defines the actual transient prefix command (see *note Defining
Transients::) and adds the transient’s infix and suffix bindings, as
described below.

   Users and third-party packages can add additional bindings using
functions such as ‘transient-insert-suffix’ (See *note Modifying
Existing Transients::).  These functions take a “suffix specification”
as one of their arguments, which has the same form as the specifications
used in ‘transient-define-prefix’.

* Menu:

* Group Specifications::
* Suffix Specifications::


File: transient.info,  Node: Group Specifications,  Next: Suffix Specifications,  Up: Binding Suffix and Infix Commands

4.2.1 Group Specifications
--------------------------

The suffix and infix commands of a transient are organized in groups.
The grouping controls how the descriptions of the suffixes are outlined
visually but also makes it possible to set certain properties for a set
of suffixes.

   Several group classes exist, some of which organize suffixes in
subgroups.  In most cases the class does not have to be specified
explicitly, but see *note Group Classes::.

   Groups are specified in the call to ‘transient-define-prefix’, using
vectors.  Because groups are represented using vectors, we cannot use
square brackets to indicate an optional element and instead use curly
brackets to do the latter.

   Group specifications then have this form:

     [{LEVEL} {DESCRIPTION} {KEYWORD VALUE}... ELEMENT...]

   The LEVEL is optional and defaults to 4.  See *note Enabling and
Disabling Suffixes::.

   The DESCRIPTION is optional.  If present, it is used as the heading
of the group.

   The KEYWORD-VALUE pairs are optional.  Each keyword has to be a
keyword symbol, either ‘:class’ or a keyword argument supported by the
constructor of that class.

   • One of these keywords, ‘:description’, is equivalent to specifying
     DESCRIPTION at the very beginning of the vector.  The
     recommendation is to use ‘:description’ if some other keyword is
     also used, for consistency, or DESCRIPTION otherwise, because it
     looks better.

   • Likewise ‘:level’ is equivalent to LEVEL.

   • Other important keywords include the ‘:if...’ keywords.  These
     keywords control whether the group is available in a certain
     situation.

     For example, one group of the ‘magit-rebase’ transient uses ‘:if
     magit-rebase-in-progress-p’, which contains the suffixes that are
     useful while rebase is already in progress; and another that uses
     ‘:if-not magit-rebase-in-progress-p’, which contains the suffixes
     that initiate a rebase.

     These predicates can also be used on individual suffixes and are
     only documented once, see *note Predicate Slots::.

   • The value of ‘:hide’, if non-‘nil’, is a predicate that controls
     whether the group is hidden by default.  The key bindings for
     suffixes of a hidden group should all use the same prefix key.
     Pressing that prefix key should temporarily show the group and its
     suffixes, which assumes that a predicate like this is used:

          (lambda ()
            (eq (car transient--redisplay-key)
                ?\C-c)) ; the prefix key shared by all bindings

   • The value of ‘:setup-children’, if non-‘nil’, is a function that
     takes one argument, a potentially list of children, and must return
     a list of children or an empty list.  This can either be used to
     somehow transform the group’s children that were defined the normal
     way, or to dynamically create the children from scratch.

     The returned children must have the same form as stored in the
     prefix’s ‘transient--layout’ property, but it is often more
     convenient to use the same form as understood by
     ‘transient-define-prefix’, described below.  If you use the latter
     approach, you can use the ‘transient-parse-child’ and
     ‘transient-parse-children’ functions to transform them from the
     convenient to the expected form.

   • The boolean ‘:pad-keys’ argument controls whether keys of all
     suffixes contained in a group are right padded, effectively
     aligning the descriptions.

   The ELEMENTs are either all subgroups, or all suffixes and strings.
(At least currently no group type exists that would allow mixing
subgroups with commands at the same level, though in principle there is
nothing that prevents that.)

   If the ELEMENTs are not subgroups, then they can be a mixture of
lists that specify commands and strings.  Strings are inserted verbatim
into the buffer.  The empty string can be used to insert gaps between
suffixes, which is particularly useful if the suffixes are outlined as a
table.

   Inside group specifications, including inside contained suffix
specifications, nothing has to be quoted and quoting anyway is invalid.
The value following a keyword, can be explicitly unquoted using ‘,’.
This feature is experimental and should be avoided.

   The form of suffix specifications is documented in the next node.


File: transient.info,  Node: Suffix Specifications,  Prev: Group Specifications,  Up: Binding Suffix and Infix Commands

4.2.2 Suffix Specifications
---------------------------

A transient’s suffix and infix commands are bound when the transient
prefix command is defined using ‘transient-define-prefix’, see *note
Defining Transients::.  The commands are organized into groups, see
*note Group Specifications::.  Here we describe the form used to bind an
individual suffix command.

   The same form is also used when later binding additional commands
using functions such as ‘transient-insert-suffix’, see *note Modifying
Existing Transients::.

   Note that an infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
“suffixes” means “suffixes (including infixes)” or “non-infix suffixes”.
Here it means the former.

   Suffix specifications have this form:

     ([LEVEL] [KEY [DESCRIPTION]] COMMAND|ARGUMENT [KEYWORD VALUE]...)

   LEVEL, KEY and DESCRIPTION can also be specified using the KEYWORDs
‘:level’, ‘:key’ and ‘:description’.  If the object that is associated
with COMMAND sets these properties, then they do not have to be
specified here.  You can however specify them here anyway, possibly
overriding the object’s values just for the binding inside this
transient.

   • LEVEL is the suffix level, an integer between 1 and 7.  See *note
     Enabling and Disabling Suffixes::.

   • KEY is the key binding, either a vector or key description string.

   • DESCRIPTION is the description, either a string or a function that
     returns a string.  The function should be a lambda expression to
     avoid ambiguity.  In some cases a symbol that is bound as a
     function would also work but to be safe you should use
     ‘:description’ in that case.

   The next element is either a command or an argument.  This is the
only argument that is mandatory in all cases.

   • COMMAND should be a symbol that is bound as a function, which has
     to be defined or at least autoloaded as a command by the time the
     containing prefix command is invoked.

     Any command will do; it does not need to have an object associated
     with it (as would be the case if ‘transient-define-suffix’ or
     ‘transient-define-infix’ were used to define it).

     COMMAND can also be a ‘lambda’ expression.

     As mentioned above, the object that is associated with a command
     can be used to set the default for certain values that otherwise
     have to be set in the suffix specification.  Therefore if there is
     no object, then you have to make sure to specify the KEY and the
     DESCRIPTION.

     As a special case, if you want to add a command that might be
     neither defined nor autoloaded, you can use a workaround like:

          (transient-insert-suffix 'some-prefix "k"
            '("!" "Ceci n'est pas une commande" no-command
              :if (lambda () (featurep 'no-library))))

     Instead of ‘featurep’ you could also use ‘require’ with a non-‘nil’
     value for NOERROR.

   • The mandatory argument can also be a command-line argument, a
     string.  In that case an anonymous command is defined and bound.

     Instead of a string, this can also be a list of two strings, in
     which case the first string is used as the short argument (which
     can also be specified using ‘:shortarg’) and the second as the long
     argument (which can also be specified using ‘:argument’).

     Only the long argument is displayed in the popup buffer.  See
     ‘transient-detect-key-conflicts’ for how the short argument may be
     used.

     Unless the class is specified explicitly, the appropriate class is
     guessed based on the long argument.  If the argument ends with ‘=’
     (e.g., ‘--format=’) then ‘transient-option’ is used, otherwise
     ‘transient-switch’.

   Finally, details can be specified using optional KEYWORD-VALUE pairs.
Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either ‘:class’ or a keyword
argument supported by the constructor of that class.  See *note Suffix
Slots::.


File: transient.info,  Node: Defining Suffix and Infix Commands,  Next: Using Infix Arguments,  Prev: Binding Suffix and Infix Commands,  Up: Defining New Commands

4.3 Defining Suffix and Infix Commands
======================================

Note that an infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
“suffixes” means “suffixes (including infixes)” or “non-infix suffixes”.

 -- Macro: transient-define-suffix name arglist [docstring] [keyword
          value]... body...
     This macro defines NAME as a transient suffix command.

     ARGLIST are the arguments that the command takes.  DOCSTRING is the
     documentation string and is optional.

     These arguments can optionally be followed by keyword-value pairs.
     Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either ‘:class’ or a
     keyword argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
     ‘transient-suffix’ class is used if the class is not specified
     explicitly.

     The BODY must begin with an ‘interactive’ form that matches
     ARGLIST.  The infix arguments are usually accessed by using
     ‘transient-args’ inside ‘interactive’.

 -- Macro: transient-define-infix name arglist [docstring] [keyword
          value]...
     This macro defines NAME as a transient infix command.

     ARGLIST is always ignored (but mandatory never-the-less) and
     reserved for future use.  DOCSTRING is the documentation string and
     is optional.

     The keyword-value pairs are mandatory.  All transient infix
     commands are ‘equal’ to each other (but not ‘eq’), so it is
     meaningless to define an infix command without also setting at
     least ‘:class’ and one other keyword (which it is depends on the
     used class, usually ‘:argument’ or ‘:variable’).

     Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either ‘:class’ or a
     keyword argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
     ‘transient-switch’ class is used if the class is not specified
     explicitly.

     The function definition is always:

          (lambda ()
            (interactive)
            (let ((obj (transient-suffix-object)))
              (transient-infix-set obj (transient-infix-read obj)))
            (transient--show))

     ‘transient-infix-read’ and ‘transient-infix-set’ are generic
     functions.  Different infix commands behave differently because the
     concrete methods are different for different infix command classes.
     In rare cases the above command function might not be suitable,
     even if you define your own infix command class.  In that case you
     have to use ‘transient-define-suffix’ to define the infix command
     and use ‘t’ as the value of the ‘:transient’ keyword.

 -- Macro: transient-define-argument name arglist [docstring] [keyword
          value]...
     This macro defines NAME as a transient infix command.

     This is an alias for ‘transient-define-infix’.  Only use this alias
     to define an infix command that actually sets an infix argument.
     To define an infix command that, for example, sets a variable, use
     ‘transient-define-infix’ instead.


File: transient.info,  Node: Using Infix Arguments,  Next: Transient State,  Prev: Defining Suffix and Infix Commands,  Up: Defining New Commands

4.4 Using Infix Arguments
=========================

The functions and the variables described below allow suffix commands to
access the value of the transient from which they were invoked; which is
the value of its infix arguments.  These variables are set when the user
invokes a suffix command that exits the transient, but before actually
calling the command.

   When returning to the command-loop after calling the suffix command,
the arguments are reset to ‘nil’ (which causes the function to return
‘nil’ too).

   Like for Emacs’ prefix arguments, it is advisable, but not mandatory,
to access the infix arguments inside the command’s ‘interactive’ form.
The preferred way of doing that is to call the ‘transient-args’
function, which for infix arguments serves about the same purpose as
‘prefix-arg’ serves for prefix arguments.

 -- Function: transient-args prefix
     This function returns the value of the transient prefix command
     PREFIX.

     If the current command was invoked from the transient prefix
     command PREFIX, then it returns the active infix arguments.  If the
     current command was not invoked from PREFIX, then it returns the
     set, saved or default value for PREFIX.

 -- Function: transient-arg-value arg args
     This function return the value of ARG as it appears in ARGS.

     For a switch a boolean is returned.  For an option the value is
     returned as a string, using the empty string for the empty value,
     or ‘nil’ if the option does not appear in ARGS.

 -- Function: transient-suffixes prefix
     This function returns the suffixes of the transient prefix command
     PREFIX.  This is a list of objects.  This function should only be
     used if you need the objects (as opposed to just their values) and
     if the current command is not being invoked from PREFIX.

 -- Variable: transient-current-suffixes
     The suffixes of the transient from which this suffix command was
     invoked.  This is a list of objects.  Usually it is sufficient to
     instead use the function ‘transient-args’, which returns a list of
     values.  In complex cases it might be necessary to use this
     variable instead, i.e., if you need access to information beside
     the value.

 -- Variable: transient-current-prefix
     The transient from which this suffix command was invoked.  The
     returned value is a ‘transient-prefix’ object, which holds
     information associated with the transient prefix command.

 -- Variable: transient-current-command
     The transient from which this suffix command was invoked.  The
     returned value is a symbol, the transient prefix command.


File: transient.info,  Node: Transient State,  Prev: Using Infix Arguments,  Up: Defining New Commands

4.5 Transient State
===================

Invoking a transient prefix command “activates” the respective
transient, i.e., it puts a transient keymap into effect, which binds the
transient’s infix and suffix commands.

   The default behavior while a transient is active is as follows:

   • Invoking an infix command does not affect the transient state; the
     transient remains active.

   • Invoking a (non-infix) suffix command “deactivates” the transient
     state by removing the transient keymap and performing some
     additional cleanup.

   • Invoking a command that is bound in a keymap other than the
     transient keymap is disallowed and trying to do so results in a
     warning.  This does not “deactivate” the transient.

   But these are just the defaults.  Whether a certain command
deactivates or “exits” the transient is configurable.  There is more
than one way in which a command can be “transient” or “non-transient”;
the exact behavior is implemented by calling a so-called “pre-command”
function.  Whether non-suffix commands are allowed to be called is
configurable per transient.

   • The transient-ness of suffix commands (including infix commands) is
     controlled by the value of their ‘transient’ slot, which can be set
     either when defining the command or when adding a binding to a
     transient while defining the respective transient prefix command.

     Valid values are booleans and the pre-commands described below.

        • ‘t’ is equivalent to ‘transient--do-stay’.
        • ‘nil’ is equivalent to ‘transient--do-exit’.
        • If ‘transient’ is unbound (and that is actually the default
          for non-infix suffixes) then the value of the prefix’s
          ‘transient-suffix’ slot is used instead.  The default value of
          that slot is ‘nil’, so the suffix’s ‘transient’ slot being
          unbound is essentially equivalent to it being ‘nil’.

   • A suffix command can be a prefix command itself, i.e., a
     “sub-prefix”.  While a sub-prefix is active we nearly always want
     ‘C-g’ to take the user back to the “super-prefix”.  However in rare
     cases this may not be desirable, and that makes the following
     complication necessary:

     For ‘transient-suffix’ objects the ‘transient’ slot is unbound.  We
     can ignore that for the most part because, as stated above, ‘nil’
     and the slot being unbound are equivalent, and mean “do exit”.
     That isn’t actually true for suffixes that are sub-prefixes though.
     For such suffixes unbound means “do exit but allow going back”,
     which is the default, while ‘nil’ means “do exit permanently”,
     which requires that slot to be explicitly set to that value.

   • The transient-ness of certain built-in suffix commands is specified
     using ‘transient-predicate-map’.  This is a special keymap, which
     binds commands to pre-commands (as opposed to keys to commands) and
     takes precedence over the ‘transient’ slot.

   The available pre-command functions are documented below.  They are
called by ‘transient--pre-command’, a function on ‘pre-command-hook’ and
the value that they return determines whether the transient is exited.
To do so the value of one of the constants ‘transient--exit’ or
‘transient--stay’ is used (that way we don’t have to remember if ‘t’
means “exit” or “stay”).

   Additionally, these functions may change the value of ‘this-command’
(which explains why they have to be called using ‘pre-command-hook’),
call ‘transient-export’, ‘transient--stack-zap’ or
‘transient--stack-push’; and set the values of ‘transient--exitp’,
‘transient--helpp’ or ‘transient--editp’.

Pre-commands for Infixes
------------------------

The default for infixes is ‘transient--do-stay’.  This is also the only
function that makes sense for infixes.

 -- Function: transient--do-stay
     Call the command without exporting variables and stay transient.

Pre-commands for Suffixes
-------------------------

By default, invoking a suffix causes the transient to be exited.

   If you want a different default behavior for a certain transient
prefix command, then set its ‘:transient-suffix’ slot.  The value can be
a boolean, answering the question "does the transient stay active, when
a suffix command is invoked?"  ‘t’ means that the transient stays
active, while ‘nil’ means that invoking a suffix exits the transient.
In either case, the exact behavior depends on whether the suffix is
itself a prefix (i.e., a sub-prefix), an infix or a regular suffix.

   The behavior for an individual suffix command can be changed by
setting its ‘transient’ slot to one of the following pre-commands.

 -- Function: transient--do-exit
     Call the command after exporting variables and exit the transient.

 -- Function: transient--do-return
     Call the command after exporting variables and return to parent
     prefix.  If there is no parent prefix, then call
     ‘transient--do-exit’.

 -- Function: transient--do-call
     Call the command after exporting variables and stay transient.

   The following pre-commands are suitable for sub-prefixes.  Only the
first should ever explicitly be set as the value of the ‘transient’
slot.

 -- Function: transient--do-recurse
     Call the transient prefix command, preparing for return to active
     transient.

     Whether we actually return to the parent transient is ultimately
     under the control of each invoked suffix.  The difference between
     this pre-command and ‘transient--do-replace’ is that it changes the
     value of the ‘transient-suffix’ slot to ‘transient--do-return’.

     If there is no parent transient, then only call this command and
     skip the second step.

 -- Function: transient--do-replace
     Call the transient prefix command, replacing the active transient.

     Unless ‘transient--do-recurse’ is explicitly used, this pre-command
     is automatically used for suffixes that are prefixes themselves,
     i.e., for sub-prefixes.

 -- Function: transient--do-suspend
     Suspend the active transient, saving the transient stack.

     This is used by the command ‘transient-suspend’ and optionally also
     by “external events” such as ‘handle-switch-frame’.  Such bindings
     should be added to ‘transient-predicate-map’.

Pre-commands for Non-Suffixes
-----------------------------

By default, non-suffixes (commands that are bound in other keymaps
beside the transient keymap) cannot be invoked.  Trying to invoke such a
command results in a warning and the transient stays active.

   If you want a different behavior, then set the
‘:transient-non-suffix’ slot of the transient prefix command.  The value
can be a boolean, answering the question, "is it allowed to invoke
non-suffix commands?"

   If the value is ‘t’ or ‘transient--do-stay’, then non-suffixes can be
invoked, when it is ‘nil’ or ‘transient--do-warn’ (the default) then
they cannot be invoked.

   The only other recommended value is ‘transient--do-leave’.  If that
is used, then non-suffixes can be invoked, but if one is invoked, then
that exits the transient.

 -- Function: transient--do-warn
     Call ‘transient-undefined’ and stay transient.

 -- Function: transient--do-stay
     Call the command without exporting variables and stay transient.

 -- Function: transient--do-leave
     Call the command without exporting variables and exit the
     transient.

Special Pre-Commands
--------------------

 -- Function: transient--do-quit-one
     If active, quit help or edit mode, else exit the active transient.

     This is used when the user pressed ‘C-g’.

 -- Function: transient--do-quit-all
     Exit all transients without saving the transient stack.

     This is used when the user pressed ‘C-q’.

 -- Function: transient--do-suspend
     Suspend the active transient, saving the transient stack.

     This is used when the user pressed ‘C-z’.

5 Classes and Methods
*********************

Transient uses classes and generic functions to make it possible to
define new types of suffix commands that are similar to existing types,
but behave differently in some aspects.  It does the same for groups and
prefix commands, though at least for prefix commands that *currently*
appears to be less important.

   Every prefix, infix and suffix command is associated with an object,
which holds information that controls certain aspects of its behavior.
This happens in two ways.

   • Associating a command with a certain class gives the command a
     type.  This makes it possible to use generic functions to do
     certain things that have to be done differently depending on what
     type of command it acts on.

     That in turn makes it possible for third-parties to add new types
     without having to convince the maintainer of Transient that that
     new type is important enough to justify adding a special case to a
     dozen or so functions.

   • Associating a command with an object makes it possible to easily
     store information that is specific to that particular command.

     Two commands may have the same type, but obviously their key
     bindings and descriptions still have to be different, for example.

     The values of some slots are functions.  The ‘reader’ slot for
     example holds a function that is used to read a new value for an
     infix command.  The values of such slots are regular functions.

     Generic functions are used when a function should do something
     different based on the type of the command, i.e., when all commands
     of a certain type should behave the same way but different from the
     behavior for other types.  Object slots that hold a regular
     function as value are used when the task that they perform is
     likely to differ even between different commands of the same type.

File: transient.info,  Node: Group Classes,  Next: Group Methods,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.1 Group Classes
=================

The type of a group can be specified using the ‘:class’ property at the
beginning of the class specification, e.g., ‘[:class transient-columns
...]’ in a call to ‘transient-define-prefix’.

   • The abstract ‘transient-child’ class is the base class of both
     ‘transient-group’ (and therefore all groups) as well as of
     ‘transient-suffix’ (and therefore all suffix and infix commands).

     This class exists because the elements (or “children”) of certain
     groups can be other groups instead of suffix and infix commands.

   • The abstract ‘transient-group’ class is the superclass of all other
     group classes.

   • The ‘transient-column’ class is the simplest group.

     This is the default “flat” group.  If the class is not specified
     explicitly and the first element is not a vector (i.e., not a
     group), then this class is used.

     This class displays each element on a separate line.

   • The ‘transient-row’ class displays all elements on a single line.

   • The ‘transient-columns’ class displays commands organized in
     columns.

     Direct elements have to be groups whose elements have to be
     commands or strings.  Each subgroup represents a column.  This
     class takes care of inserting the subgroups’ elements.

     This is the default “nested” group.  If the class is not specified
     explicitly and the first element is a vector (i.e., a group), then
     this class is used.

   • The ‘transient-subgroups’ class wraps other groups.

     Direct elements have to be groups whose elements have to be
     commands or strings.  This group inserts an empty line between
     subgroups.  The subgroups themselves are responsible for displaying
     their elements.


File: transient.info,  Node: Group Methods,  Next: Prefix Classes,  Prev: Group Classes,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.2 Group Methods
=================

 -- Function: transient-setup-children group children
     This generic function can be used to setup the children or a group.

     The default implementation usually just returns the children
     unchanged, but if the ‘setup-children’ slot of GROUP is non-‘nil’,
     then it calls that function with CHILDREN as the only argument and
     returns the value.

     The children are given as a (potentially empty) list consisting of
     either group or suffix specifications.  These functions can make
     arbitrary changes to the children including constructing new
     children from scratch.

 -- Function: transient--insert-group group
     This generic function formats the group and its elements and
     inserts the result into the current buffer, which is a temporary
     buffer.  The contents of that buffer are later inserted into the
     popup buffer.

     Functions that are called by this function may need to operate in
     the buffer from which the transient was called.  To do so they can
     temporarily make the ‘transient--source-buffer’ the current buffer.


File: transient.info,  Node: Prefix Classes,  Next: Suffix Classes,  Prev: Group Methods,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.3 Prefix Classes
==================

Currently the ‘transient-prefix’ class is being used for all prefix
commands and there is only a single generic function that can be
specialized based on the class of a prefix command.

 -- Function: transient--history-init obj
     This generic function is called while setting up the transient and
     is responsible for initializing the ‘history’ slot.  This is the
     transient-wide history; many individual infixes also have a history
     of their own.

     The default (and currently only) method extracts the value from the
     global variable ‘transient-history’.

   A transient prefix command’s object is stored in the
‘transient--prefix’ property of the command symbol.  While a transient
is active, a clone of that object is stored in the variable
‘transient--prefix’.  A clone is used because some changes that are made
to the active transient’s object should not affect later invocations.


File: transient.info,  Node: Suffix Classes,  Next: Suffix Methods,  Prev: Prefix Classes,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.4 Suffix Classes
==================

   • All suffix and infix classes derive from ‘transient-suffix’, which
     in turn derives from ‘transient-child’, from which
     ‘transient-group’ also derives (see *note Group Classes::).

   • All infix classes derive from the abstract ‘transient-infix’ class,
     which in turn derives from the ‘transient-suffix’ class.

     Infixes are a special type of suffixes.  The primary difference is
     that infixes always use the ‘transient--do-stay’ pre-command, while
     non-infix suffixes use a variety of pre-commands (see *note
     Transient State::).  Doing that is most easily achieved by using
     this class, though theoretically it would be possible to define an
     infix class that does not do so.  If you do that then you get to
     implement many methods.

     Also, infixes and non-infix suffixes are usually defined using
     different macros (see *note Defining Suffix and Infix Commands::).

   • Classes used for infix commands that represent arguments should be
     derived from the abstract ‘transient-argument’ class.

   • The ‘transient-switch’ class (or a derived class) is used for infix
     arguments that represent command-line switches (arguments that do
     not take a value).

   • The ‘transient-option’ class (or a derived class) is used for infix
     arguments that represent command-line options (arguments that do
     take a value).

   • The ‘transient-switches’ class can be used for a set of mutually
     exclusive command-line switches.

   • The ‘transient-files’ class can be used for a ‘--’ argument that
     indicates that all remaining arguments are files.

   • Classes used for infix commands that represent variables should
     derived from the abstract ‘transient-variable’ class.

   Magit defines additional classes, which can serve as examples for the
fancy things you can do without modifying Transient.  Some of these
classes will likely get generalized and added to Transient.  For now
they are very much subject to change and not documented.

5.5 Suffix Methods
==================

To get information about the methods implementing these generic
functions use ‘describe-function’.

* Menu:

* Suffix Value Methods::
* Suffix Format Methods::


File: transient.info,  Node: Suffix Value Methods,  Next: Suffix Format Methods,  Up: Suffix Methods

5.5.1 Suffix Value Methods
--------------------------

 -- Function: transient-init-value obj
     This generic function sets the initial value of the object OBJ.

     This function is called for all suffix commands, but unless a
     concrete method is implemented this falls through to the default
     implementation, which is a noop.  In other words this usually only
     does something for infix commands, but note that this is not
     implemented for the abstract class ‘transient-infix’, so if your
     class derives from that directly, then you must implement a method.

 -- Function: transient-infix-read obj
     This generic function determines the new value of the infix object
     OBJ.

     This function merely determines the value; ‘transient-infix-set’ is
     used to actually store the new value in the object.

     For most infix classes this is done by reading a value from the
     user using the reader specified by the ‘reader’ slot (using the
     ‘transient-infix-value’ method described below).

     For some infix classes the value is changed without reading
     anything in the minibuffer, i.e., the mere act of invoking the
     infix command determines what the new value should be, based on the
     previous value.

 -- Function: transient-prompt obj
     This generic function returns the prompt to be used to read infix
     object OBJ’s value.

 -- Function: transient-infix-set obj value
     This generic function sets the value of infix object OBJ to VALUE.

 -- Function: transient-infix-value obj
     This generic function returns the value of the suffix object OBJ.

     This function is called by ‘transient-args’ (which see), meaning
     this function is how the value of a transient is determined so that
     the invoked suffix command can use it.

     Currently most values are strings, but that is not set in stone.
     ‘nil’ is not a value, it means “no value”.

     Usually only infixes have a value, but see the method for
     ‘transient-suffix’.

 -- Function: transient-init-scope obj
     This generic function sets the scope of the suffix object OBJ.

     The scope is actually a property of the transient prefix, not of
     individual suffixes.  However it is possible to invoke a suffix
     command directly instead of from a transient.  In that case, if the
     suffix expects a scope, then it has to determine that itself and
     store it in its ‘scope’ slot.

     This function is called for all suffix commands, but unless a
     concrete method is implemented this falls through to the default
     implementation, which is a noop.


File: transient.info,  Node: Suffix Format Methods,  Prev: Suffix Value Methods,  Up: Suffix Methods

5.5.2 Suffix Format Methods
---------------------------

 -- Function: transient-format obj
     This generic function formats and returns OBJ for display.

     When this function is called, then the current buffer is some
     temporary buffer.  If you need the buffer from which the prefix
     command was invoked to be current, then do so by temporarily making
     ‘transient--source-buffer’ current.

 -- Function: transient-format-key obj
     This generic function formats OBJ’s ‘key’ for display and returns
     the result.

 -- Function: transient-format-description obj
     This generic function formats OBJ’s ‘description’ for display and
     returns the result.

 -- Function: transient-format-value obj
     This generic function formats OBJ’s value for display and returns
     the result.

 -- Function: transient-show-help obj
     Show help for the prefix, infix or suffix command represented by
     OBJ.

     For prefixes, show the info manual, if that is specified using the
     ‘info-manual’ slot.  Otherwise, show the manpage if that is
     specified using the ‘man-page’ slot.  Otherwise, show the command’s
     doc string.

     For suffixes, show the command’s doc string.

     For infixes, show the manpage if that is specified.  Otherwise show
     the command’s doc string.


File: transient.info,  Node: Prefix Slots,  Next: Suffix Slots,  Prev: Suffix Methods,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.6 Prefix Slots
================

   • ‘show-help’, ‘man-page’ or ‘info-manual’ can be used to specify the
     documentation for the prefix and its suffixes.  The command
     ‘transient-help’ uses the method ‘transient-show-help’ (which see)
     to lookup and use these values.

   • ‘history-key’ If multiple prefix commands should share a single
     value, then this slot has to be set to the same value for all of
     them.  You probably don’t want that.

   • ‘transient-suffix’ and ‘transient-non-suffix’ play a part when
     determining whether the currently active transient prefix command
     remains active/transient when a suffix or arbitrary non-suffix
     command is invoked.  See *note Transient State::.

   • ‘incompatible’ A list of lists.  Each sub-list specifies a set of
     mutually exclusive arguments.  Enabling one of these arguments
     causes the others to be disabled.  An argument may appear in
     multiple sub-lists.

   • ‘scope’ For some transients it might be necessary to have a sort of
     secondary value, called a “scope”.  See ‘transient-define-prefix’.

Internal Prefix Slots
---------------------

These slots are mostly intended for internal use.  They should not be
set in calls to ‘transient-define-prefix’.

   • ‘prototype’ When a transient prefix command is invoked, then a
     clone of that object is stored in the global variable
     ‘transient--prefix’ and the prototype is stored in the clone’s
     ‘prototype’ slot.

   • ‘command’ The command, a symbol.  Each transient prefix command
     consists of a command, which is stored in a symbol’s function slot
     and an object, which is stored in the ‘transient--prefix’ property
     of the same symbol.

   • ‘level’ The level of the prefix commands.  The suffix commands
     whose layer is equal or lower are displayed.  See *note Enabling
     and Disabling Suffixes::.

   • ‘value’ The likely outdated value of the prefix.  Instead of
     accessing this slot directly you should use the function
     ‘transient-get-value’, which is guaranteed to return the up-to-date
     value.

   • ‘history’ and ‘history-pos’ are used to keep track of historic
     values.  Unless you implement your own ‘transient-infix-read’
     method you should not have to deal with these slots.


File: transient.info,  Node: Suffix Slots,  Next: Predicate Slots,  Prev: Prefix Slots,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.7 Suffix Slots
================

Here we document most of the slots that are only available for suffix
objects.  Some slots are shared by suffix and group objects, they are
documented in *note Predicate Slots::.

   Also see *note Suffix Classes::.

Slots of ‘transient-suffix’
---------------------------

   • ‘key’ The key, a key vector or a key description string.

   • ‘command’ The command, a symbol.

   • ‘transient’ Whether to stay transient.  See *note Transient
     State::.

   • ‘format’ The format used to display the suffix in the popup buffer.
     It must contain the following %-placeholders:

        • ‘%k’ For the key.
        • ‘%d’ For the description.
        • ‘%v’ For the infix value.  Non-infix suffixes don’t have a
          value.

   • ‘description’ The description, either a string or a function that
     is called with no argument and returns a string.

   • ‘show-help’ A function used to display help for the suffix.  If
     unspecified, the prefix controls how help is displayed for its
     suffixes.

Slots of ‘transient-infix’
--------------------------

Some of these slots are only meaningful for some of the subclasses.
They are defined here anyway to allow sharing certain methods.

   • ‘argument’ The long argument, e.g., ‘--verbose’.

   • ‘shortarg’ The short argument, e.g., ‘-v’.

   • ‘value’ The value.  Should not be accessed directly.

   • ‘init-value’ Function that is responsible for setting the object’s
     value.  If bound, then this is called with the object as the only
     argument.  Usually this is not bound, in which case the object’s
     primary ‘transient-init-value’ method is called instead.

   • ‘unsavable’ Whether the value of the suffix is not saved as part of
     the prefixes.

   • ‘multi-value’ For options, whether the option can have multiple
     values.  If this is non-‘nil’, then the values are read using
     ‘completing-read-multiple’ by default and if you specify your own
     reader, then it should read the values using that function or
     similar.

     Supported non-‘nil’ values are:

        • Use ‘rest’ for an option that can have multiple values.  This
          is useful e.g., for an ‘--’ argument that indicates that all
          remaining arguments are files (such as ‘git log -- file1
          file2’).

          In the list returned by ‘transient-args’ such an option and
          its values are represented by a single list of the form
          ‘(ARGUMENT . VALUES)’.

        • Use ‘repeat’ for an option that can be specified multiple
          times.

          In the list returned by ‘transient-args’ each instance of the
          option and its value appears separately in the usual from, for
          example: ‘("--another-argument" "--option=first"
          "--option=second")’.

     In both cases the option’s values have to be specified in the
     default value of a prefix using the same format as returned by
     ‘transient-args’, e.g., ‘("--other" "--o=1" "--o=2" ("--" "f1"
     "f2"))’.

   • ‘always-read’ For options, whether to read a value on every
     invocation.  If this is nil, then options that have a value are
     simply unset and have to be invoked a second time to set a new
     value.

   • ‘allow-empty’ For options, whether the empty string is a valid
     value.

   • ‘history-key’ The key used to store the history.  This defaults to
     the command name.  This is useful when multiple infixes should
     share the same history because their values are of the same kind.

   • ‘reader’ The function used to read the value of an infix.  Not used
     for switches.  The function takes three arguments, PROMPT,
     INITIAL-INPUT and HISTORY, and must return a string.

   • ‘prompt’ The prompt used when reading the value, either a string or
     a function that takes the object as the only argument and which
     returns a prompt string.

   • ‘choices’ A list of valid values.  How exactly that is used depends
     on the class of the object.

Slots of ‘transient-variable’
-----------------------------

   • ‘variable’ The variable.

Slots of ‘transient-switches’
-----------------------------

   • ‘argument-format’ The display format.  Must contain ‘%s’, one of
     the ‘choices’ is substituted for that.  E.g., ‘--%s-order’.

   • ‘argument-regexp’ The regexp used to match any one of the switches.
     E.g., ‘\\(--\\(topo\\|author-date\\|date\\)-order\\)’.


File: transient.info,  Node: Predicate Slots,  Prev: Suffix Slots,  Up: Classes and Methods

5.8 Predicate Slots
===================

Suffix and group objects share some predicate slots that control whether
a group or suffix should be available depending on some state.  Only one
of these slots can be used at the same time.  It is undefined what
happens if you use more than one.

   • ‘if’ Enable if predicate returns non-‘nil’.
   • ‘if-not’ Enable if predicate returns ‘nil’.
   • ‘if-non-nil’ Enable if variable’s value is non-‘nil’.
   • ‘if-nil’ Enable if variable’s value is ‘nil’.
   • ‘if-mode’ Enable if major-mode matches value.
   • ‘if-not-mode’ Enable if major-mode does not match value.
   • ‘if-derived’ Enable if major-mode derives from value.
   • ‘if-not-derived’ Enable if major-mode does not derive from value.

   One more slot is shared between group and suffix classes, ‘level’.
Like the slots documented above, it is a predicate, but it is used for a
different purpose.  The value has to be an integer between 1 and 7.
‘level’ controls whether a suffix or a group should be available
depending on user preference.  See *note Enabling and Disabling
Suffixes::.

6.1 Comparison With Prefix Keys and Prefix Arguments
====================================================

While transient commands were inspired by regular prefix keys and prefix
arguments, they are also quite different and much more complex.

   The following diagrams illustrate some of the differences.

   • ‘(c)’ represents a return to the command loop.
   • ‘(+)’ represents the user’s choice to press one key or another.
   • ‘{WORD}’ are possible behaviors.
   • ‘{NUMBER}’ is a footnote.

Regular Prefix Commands
-----------------------

See *note (elisp)Prefix Keys::.

                                       ,--> command1 --> (c)
                                       |
     (c)-(+)-> prefix command or key --+--> command2 --> (c)
                                       |
                                       `--> command3 --> (c)

   • ‘{1}’ Transients can be configured to be exited when a suffix
     command is invoked.  The default is to do so for all suffixes
     except for those that are common to all transients and which are
     used to perform tasks such as providing help and saving the value
     of the infix arguments for future invocations.  The behavior can
     also be specified for individual suffix commands and may even
     depend on state.

   • ‘{2}’ Transients can be configured to allow the user to invoke
     non-suffix commands.  The default is to not allow that and instead
     warn the user.

   Despite already being rather complex, even the last diagram leaves
out many details.  Most importantly it implies that the decision whether
to remain transient is made later than it actually is made (for the most
part a function on ‘pre-command-hook’ is responsible).  But such
implementation details are of little relevance to users and are covered
elsewhere.

6.2 Comparison With Other Packages
==================================

Magit-Popup
-----------

Transient is the successor to Magit-Popup (see *note
(magit-popup)Top::).

   One major difference between these two implementations of the same
ideas is that while Transient uses transient keymaps and embraces the
command-loop, Magit-Popup implemented an inferior mechanism that does
not use transient keymaps and that instead of using the command-loop
implements a naive alternative based on ‘read-char’.

   Magit-Popup does not use classes and generic functions and defining a
new command type is near impossible as it involves adding hard-coded
special-cases to many functions.  Because of that only a single new type
was added, which was not already part of Magit-Popup’s initial release.

   A lot of things are hard-coded in Magit-Popup.  One random example is
that the key bindings for switches must begin with ‘-’ and those for
options must begin with ‘=’.

Hydra
-----

Hydra (see <https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra>) is another package that
provides features similar to those of Transient.

   Both packages use transient keymaps to make a set of commands
temporarily available and show the available commands in a popup buffer.

   A Hydra “body” is equivalent to a Transient “prefix” and a Hydra
“head” is equivalent to a Transient “suffix”.  Hydra has no equivalent
of a Transient “infix”.

   Both hydras and transients can be used as simple command dispatchers.
Used like this they are similar to regular prefix commands and prefix
keys, except that the available commands are shown in the popup buffer.

   (Another package that does this is ‘which-key’.  It does so
automatically for any incomplete key sequence.  The advantage of that
approach is that no additional work is necessary; the disadvantage is
that the available commands are not organized semantically.)

   Both Hydra and Transient provide features that go beyond simple
command dispatchers:

   • Invoking a command from a hydra does not necessarily exit the
     hydra.  That makes it possible to invoke the same command again,
     but using a shorter key sequence (i.e., the key that was used to
     enter the hydra does not have to be pressed again).

     Transient supports that too, but for now this feature is not a
     focus and the interface is a bit more complicated.  A very basic
     example using the current interface:

          (transient-define-prefix outline-navigate ()
            :transient-suffix     'transient--do-stay
            :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-warn
            [("p" "previous visible heading" outline-previous-visible-heading)
             ("n" "next visible heading" outline-next-visible-heading)])

   • Transient supports infix arguments; values that are set by infix
     commands and then consumed by the invoked suffix command(s).

     To my knowledge, Hydra does not support that.

   Both packages make it possible to specify how exactly the available
commands are outlined:

   • With Hydra this is often done using an explicit format string,
     which gives authors a lot of flexibility and makes it possible to
     do fancy things.

     The downside of this is that it becomes harder for a user to add
     additional commands to an existing hydra and to change key
     bindings.

   • Transient allows the author of a transient to organize the commands
     into groups and the use of generic functions allows authors of
     transients to control exactly how a certain command type is
     displayed.

     However while Transient supports giving sections a heading it does
     not currently support giving the displayed information more
     structure by, for example, using box-drawing characters.

     That could be implemented by defining a new group class, which lets
     the author specify a format string.  It should be possible to
     implement that without modifying any existing code, but it does not
     currently exist.

Appendix A FAQ
**************

A.1 Can I control how the popup buffer is displayed?
====================================================

Yes, see ‘transient-display-buffer-action’ in *note Configuration::.

A.2 How can I copy text from the popup buffer?
==============================================

To be able to mark text in any transient popup buffer using the mouse,
you have to add the following binding.  Note that the region won’t be
visualized, while doing so.  After you have quit the transient popup,
you will be able to yank it another buffer.

     (keymap-set transient-predicate-map
                 "<mouse-set-region>"
                 #'transient--do-stay)

A.3 Why did some of the key bindings change?
============================================

You may have noticed that the bindings for some of the common commands
do *not* have the prefix ‘C-x’ and that furthermore some of these
commands are grayed out while others are not.  That unfortunately is a
bit confusing if the section of common commands is not shown
permanently, making the following explanation necessary.

   The purpose of usually hiding that section but showing it after the
user pressed the respective prefix key is to conserve space and not
overwhelm users with too much noise, while allowing the user to quickly
list common bindings on demand.

   That however should not keep us from using the best possible key
bindings.  The bindings that do use a prefix do so to avoid wasting too
many non-prefix bindings, keeping them available for use in individual
transients.  The bindings that do not use a prefix and that are *not*
grayed out are very important bindings that are *always* available, even
when invoking the “common command key prefix” or *any other*
transient-specific prefix.  The non-prefix keys that *are* grayed out
however, are not available when any incomplete prefix key sequence is
active.  They do not use the “common command key prefix” because it is
likely that users want to invoke them several times in a row and e.g.,
‘M-p M-p M-p’ is much more convenient than ‘C-x M-p C-x M-p C-x M-p’.

   You may also have noticed that the “Set” command is bound to ‘C-x s’,
while Magit-Popup used to bind ‘C-c C-c’ instead.  I have seen several
users praise the latter binding (sic), so I did not change it
willy-nilly.  The reason that I changed it is that using different
prefix keys for different common commands, would have made the temporary
display of the common commands even more confusing, i.e., after pressing
‘C-c’ all the bindings that begin with the ‘C-x’ prefix would be grayed
out.

   Using a single prefix for common commands key means that all other
potential prefix keys can be used for transient-specific commands
*without* the section of common commands also popping up.  ‘C-c’ in
particular is a prefix that I want to (and already do) use for Magit,
and also using that for a common command would prevent me from doing so.

   (Also see the next question.)

A.4 Why does ‘q’ not quit popups anymore?
=========================================

I agree that ‘q’ is a good binding for commands that quit something.
This includes quitting whatever transient is currently active, but it
also includes quitting whatever it is that some specific transient is
controlling.  The transient ‘magit-blame’ for example binds ‘q’ to the
command that turns ‘magit-blame-mode’ off.

   So I had to decide if ‘q’ should quit the active transient (like
Magit-Popup used to) or whether ‘C-g’ should do that instead, so that
‘q’ could be bound in individual transient to whatever commands make
sense for them.  Because all other letters are already reserved for use
by individual transients, I have decided to no longer make an exception
for ‘q’.

   If you want to get ‘q’’s old binding back then you can do so.  Doing
that is a bit more complicated than changing a single key binding, so I
have implemented a function, ‘transient-bind-q-to-quit’ that makes the
necessary changes.  See its doc string for more information.

*************************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified
     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
     restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor
     version”.

     A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, “control”
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To “grant”
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
