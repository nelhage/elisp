A single-line comment block is a continuous lines with same \"comment level\".

Comment level is:

- Number of slashes after indentation, if the line contains characters
  other than slashes and spaces.

- Comment level of the following line if the line contains only slashes
  and spaces, and the following line is a single line comment and it have
  fewer or equal number of slashes.

- Comment level of the preceding line if the line contains only slashes
  and spaces, and the preceding line is a single line comment and it have
  fewer or equal number of slashes.

- Number of slashes after indentation, otherwise.


Examples:

Code comment after documentation comment:

/// paragraph 1: aaa bbb
/// ccc.
// paragraph 2: aaa bbb
// ccc.


Comment box:

///////////////////////
// paragraph 1: aaa bbb
// ccc.
//
// paragraph 2: aaa bbb
// ccc.
///////////////////////


Code comment before and after comment box:

// paragraph 1: aaa bbb
// ccc.
////////////////////////////
/// paragraph 2: aaa bbb
/// ccc.
////////////////////////////
// paragraph 3: aaa bbb
// ccc.

Return tuple (START . END) where START is the point before the first slash of
the block, and END is the end of the last comment, excluding the last line
break if any.
