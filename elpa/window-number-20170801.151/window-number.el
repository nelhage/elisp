;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Window number mode allows you to select windows by numbers.
;;
;; `window-number-switch' same as `other-window' (C-x o) when windows less than three.
;; If have three windows (or more) showing, `window-number-switch' will
;; highlight window number at mode-line then prompt you input window number.
;;
;; I binding `window-number-switch' on 'C-x o' to instead `other-window'.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put window-number.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'window-number)
;; (window-number-mode 1)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;; `window-number-active-foreground'
;; `window-number-active-background'
;; `window-number-inactive-foreground'
;; `window-number-inactive-background'
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET window-number RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2014/11/06
;;      * Fix some compile warnings
;;
;; 2014/01/24
;;      * Fixed bug of `window-number-set-active-color' and `window-number-set-inactive-color' that not use user's color.
;;
;; 2014/01/01
;;      * Add new function `window-number-switch'
;;      * Add group `window-number' and customize colors.
;;      * Highlight window number on mode-line when `window-number-switch' prompt input.
;;      * Use `completing-read' instead `read-string' for better input experience.
;;
;; 2004
;;      * First released.
