;; A company backend for [racer][].
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;; Install and configure [racer][].  And add to your `init.el':
;;
;;     (require 'company-racer)
;;
;;     (with-eval-after-load 'company
;;       (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-racer))
;;
;; Check https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode for details.
;;
;; Troubleshooting:
;;
;; + [racer][] requires to set the environment variable with
;;   `RUST_SRC_PATH' and needs to be an absolute path:
;;
;;       (unless (getenv "RUST_SRC_PATH")
;;         (setenv "RUST_SRC_PATH" (expand-file-name "~/path/to/rust/src")))

;; TODO:
;;
;; + [ ] Add support for find-definition (maybe not in this package.)
